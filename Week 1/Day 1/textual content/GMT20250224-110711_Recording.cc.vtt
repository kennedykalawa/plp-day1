00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Welcome everyone to This afternoon session for software engineering essentials You read instructor check-in And I'll be guiding you through today's lesson.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So basically, today we want to unlock only two questions as an introduction like Why are we here and how shall we be here? You know, simple as that. Keep it simple.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So… I'll be guiding you on and asking your attending to all your queries mostly pertaining your

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Lms navigation. So make sure that um you tune in and be very attentive because I don't intend to do this any other time later So make sure that you are really keen to reason and to pay attention.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So that your journey will be easier and you'll have a simple time why navigating the rms and working around rms So welcome to PRP Academy and Here at PLP Academy.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Learning happens on the LMS. Maybe you've never run through uh come across such as system before But here we manage our learning using the learning management system. That's what we call LMS.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And the RMS is just this is like now your actual classroom okay this is where learning happens okay so learning does not happen outside LMS.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Learning happens to be in the LMS. So it's very important for you to be able to know how to navigate the LMS So that… your planning journey will be simple and we'll make it quite wonderful okay like There should be no struggle. You shouldn't struggle at all.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And, um. I taught the morning class guys that we left struggles for our forefathers who were struggling for independence For us.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We form okay so you should be having the fall so i want to give you the flow of events And how just laying a good orientation on how things will be here and how we will be able to work around together

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So that your running journey will be quite uh a swing a soft tensed swim okay Yes.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So let's start. First, for you to be here, you must have received your credentials, login credentials on LMS.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Just in case you have any login issues. Not listening very well if you have any login issues that is maybe you don't have a password a username for the enemy's this is what you do. You come here at this button we call this button um

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Ticketing button it has a question type on it So the ticketing button you can lace it for any technical issues. Maybe you logged in into your LMS and you can't see anything. It's just blank. It can happen.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Okay, maybe you log into your lms and there are some funny funny maybe weird messages you can't understand what it is. Maybe you're told i can't access content can't you know those there could be any weird thing that you can count on there and is now that's a technical issue.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So for that matter, we have the ticketing button. So click on the ticketing button And then… fill in your names and your email.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:52.000
The email that you logged in you registered to be you registered PRP Academy with your phone number and then state what kind of issue are you facing for example Yeah, there are so many issues you can raise. For example.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Say you have a organ issue okay or maybe a content issue or a progress issue or something whichever issue you might be having.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Okay, sorry. Okay. So use 13 maybe a rogue.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Issue. So maybe here I can check maybe my name. I see it's Powerland.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And maybe I enter my mail. Pfb Academy.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Uh… Oh.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:45.000
That means… Just giving you a reference. So something always sought Then maybe I can put my number as 769.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
One, two, three, four, five. That's a competent number.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Oh.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Sounds good. That's a good one. Yes, sir. Then subject, maybe maybe the content can't access the content.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Content access issue. Content.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Access. Issue.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Then after doing that. You stating your content access issue um you can never bore it. For example, you can do a screenshot of the problem and you can tag a picture you can for example tag a picture here a picture of anything maybe something you got something you got

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Let's C. Oh, okay.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Let's say that's our picture, that's our snapshot we snapped our whatever we were facing so you can target we see So whatever that maybe you encounter then you can give an explanation below of what it is okay of whatever thing that could be on your

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:28.000
This image okay And then after that, doing that now you can now I'll make sure that you can now make sure that you can now you are able to raise your tickets.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Okay, now you can maybe you can give a short description I encountered this error.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I encountered. Uh this uh you know Just… Yeah. Cool.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That's cool. Please help. Okay.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Nice. So there we go.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Once you have done that. You can now… lays the issue.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You click this button you see this button is active now this issue now you just need to raise issue Then wait, we didn't read to… 24 hours your issue should be updated okay Yeah, so once you I'll just raise the issue.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Weights the fastest or the quickest maybe the issue can be solved is maybe within three hours if it generates so much within maybe 24 hours okay That is, if you have login issues that's how you solve them.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Now. Beyond login issues.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Maybe you have… Oh.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:09.000
A question you're like we have this button we call faqs frequently asked questions So for example, this button will you'll some of the frequent common questions that students have raised before.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Like, for example, can I code without a laptop maybe this was a question that was asked before.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And you'll get an answer. You can code in a phone using rebrs I made a list is also mobile adaptive. You'll offer good experience on smart masks. However, we suggest an internet connected laptop or PC for best learning experience okay

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:45.000
How can I record classes for my reference? You see, so all these types of questions that maybe students have asked before and they've got answered.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You can use these FAQs to see frequent ask questions and your issue could be easily solved.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Okay, that is that so i hope you understand me well aware.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:10.000
When it comes to login issues and maybe content access issues now that's it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But we can also now check on what is the rms like Why are we here? Okay.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So first we are here because we want to learn software engineering.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Okay, so basically What that means you will be equipped with software development issues skills, not issues but skills you'll be equipped with software development skills both in Web.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Based apps and mobile-based apps. Okay. And also, once you are done with that skilling you will also receive a good uh nice orientation and specialization whereby you can specialize either to be a full web developer Or you can also specialize

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.000
To be um mobile web developer, progressive web app developer.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Or maybe you can also I'll be able to check on You can also be able to log in as specialized as an AI machine learning develop. So you can be an AI engineer after this So our main model of communication

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Easy communication to your to you learners, we use Telegram.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So I hope you have a telegram up. Like this one mine installed in your phone Yeah, the reason why we use telegram because it's easy to use and Mostly.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You'll find that there is it's it's it's allows a lot of people, a lot of groups large groups organizations. So for example, you can see Feb 2025 cohort announcements have around 6,13 subscribers so that's a right number whatsapp cannot

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:28.000
For that so we end up using telegram it favors as it can hold up to 10 000 so we have were covered by telecom.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So maybe if you want to know our more communication link tree maybe on our media there's this nice post that was made a few days ago on Telegram. You can meet it here.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The ring tree it's all about link tree

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And you'll find that we've got a very nice communication link tree of how we do our communication so mostly join power and project official community there you go.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You can also join this code. Community fun games events opportunities all that that is power women Now, each and every one of these you just need to come here and check.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:28.000
If you want to connect just click how you want to connect with them okay yes it becomes easier it becomes easier So through that you can be able to connect our social media hurdles very easily.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:51.000
On this screen okay wherever you want, wherever you feel you can be able to check But make sure you are on telegram discord as well is something good And… Yeah, you can follow us also on Instagram and other social media pages like x

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And what have you. It's okay use that tree Okay, that post is on Yeah, it's here on It was made on, let me see the date.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It was, I think it was of february 10 The day the channel was created you'll find that it was the first post.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Yes. So you'll get it there. So make sure you log in that.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:30.000
After that, there is… Something else I want you to check. For example.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Oh. Yeah, once you got accepted this is also from there telegram Um… Of course, let me see. Let me see what is this.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Oh, there's Lana Guide, yes. Open the runner guide.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Looks good. There you go. This is our runner guide okay So you find there is a very good guide on for all runners project peer peer academy.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So there is the runner selection criteria that was followed. How did you come here? How did you make it here?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So first, we checked in the application form whether you first passed the literacy there was a literacy test then you should have scored a 50% But beyond that, he checked whether you have access to a laptop or a computer then internet after that we check for the computer literacy test.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Okay so if you are here it means here you should have access to internets and will have access to a laptop Okay. Yes, we as power and we don't provide laptops, we don't provide internet connectivity it is you to ensure that you have those two

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Okay, it's on your side Okay, so once we ensured you are there.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Then this is our core running modules. These are the basics You learn software engineering essentials what you're learning correctly for the first two weeks.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Then you learn also database You learn web development, employability and startup building and Python. Those are basic modules.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So this will take week one up to around week nine. So you will go with them week one to week you lenders okay Then after that.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
You will… have to specialize after week eight.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That is on week nine you have specialization now on specialization, you specialize on full stack Development Month.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
It means man stands for mongol. The express react and node.js.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Okay so uh man is uh specialization of web applications it means you'll be a full developer full stock developer in web applications.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So software testing. Is all about… being able to guarantee and prioritize performance of software so you'll be know how to test the software whether it's a nap and how to check quality assurance automated testing and such okay Yeah, software testing is quite a high demand in demand skill

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:17.000
In the current career choices. Then we will check on you can also specialize with mobile friendly with that whereby you can learn how to develop web progressive apps with mobile apps either iOS or… Android.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Yes, ups, but using DAT and FRATA and then After that, you can also specialize in AI and software engineering, whereby you run ai machine learning You learn how to model AI machines and now you can now commit tasks using AI.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Okay so basically that's it. You can only specialize in one Okay, so by the time you are at week nine, why not you have you have evaluated yourself maybe what are your interests in tech.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And then you will know which one to specialize in okay Then how will the program do so our Classes are 10.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:27.000
To 12 p.m, the first class 10 a.m to 12 p.m Then we have the afternoon class, the class you are in now 2 p.m. To 4 p.m. And the last class is 6.30 to 8 that TPM.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
East African time. We also have gaming sessions on Saturdays from 11 a.m. To 12 p.m.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And one hour. So make sure you join me for games your running is a bit gamified It's good. So how it works is that for the foundation for software engineering essentials lands for two weeks with one and two Monday to Friday.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Then we have full stack. Week two to eight whereby you'll be learning about database entrepreneurship web development python and gaming on Saturdays. All right.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And then finally, we have specialization week nine to week 15 or 16 there.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Okay, so that's how you'll spend your 16 wants your 16 weeks Okay.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:29.000
And you'll have some belief check-ins of startups where you can share progress and plans for casting accountability and collaboration.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
So basically that's how your program is will be laid out.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Something else to note. Some of the key RMS features is my learning submission timetable groups community ticketing dashboard FAQs. I've already shown you FAQs and ticketing it are built with their store shortly after our deal with all these i'll show you how to work with

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
All these others okay Cool. All right.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Then… some of the running activities you get involved in is things like master crafts.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Master classes masterclass is a simply a virtual class that happens once and you are taught by an industry, a professional from the industry of tech and then he will explain a concept maybe Any concept be like maybe AI agents, how you can maybe use AI agents

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:51.000
In your job automation skills like one we had last weekend. It was about AI agents yeah so that is a master class It happens once so make sure you in your running process, you should at least attend two master classes

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Okay. Also. There'll be hot covers a hackathon is a competition A competition phone showcase your skills in terms of how you can implement your skills by solving little world solutions.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Okay so you are giving reward solutions to real world problems okay So make sure you attend at least two hackathons in your running progress.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:37.000
We can share this boot camps. These are challenges that will come up during weekend where you you also contest for coding and developing and developing great softwares.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Over the weekend and you can do it in groups that's the beauty of it Yes, you don't have to struggle.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:54.000
On hackathons, you can be able to present a project or an idea as a group or as an individual.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Then we have coffee and cold. Since most of our learning is virtual.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:15.000
We have a physical event we call coffee and cold So we gather maybe, for example, in an institution Mostly this happens in Kenya and Nigeria because that's where we have a lot of presence, physical presence students.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:31.000
We look forward to expanding. Coffee and coat to other countries as time wraps up. Yes, we will check how we can be able to unlab that.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:43.000
We meet physically we share coffee And we could okay yeah so that is that Then we have town hall sessions.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:24:00.000
These are sessions designed for you to give feedback. Okay, so you have a session for giving feedback on maybe your progress maybe you are stuck somewhere you can be able to raise your hand and say, hey, I'm finding it difficult here and here.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Please help and you get helped. We also have guest registrants.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Now, guest lectures are those moments when, for example, on the read module instructor for software engineering You can invite others, reach channels to come and train you on a concept like tomorrow invite a guest lectavan.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Just to take you through it and github So I can invite gastric through a concept.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Guest lectures we talk of guest lectures Then we have certification.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Now the certification here we have two types of certificates

00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:08.000
The first type of certificate is certificate of achievement it's awarded to those who meet evaluation criteria that is you develop a fully functional project and you successfully submit a pitch deck.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:17.000
So this certificate of achievement recognizes outstanding performance and the ability to apply learned skills.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:31.000
In a practical setting. So the recipients of these, anyone who receives this certificate of achievement will be placed in the current tambour.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Poor of job opportunities. Access and potential career placements.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:50.000
We intend to praise more than 3,000 people to connect more than 3000 of people to jobs So make sure you fall under this certificate of achievement.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Yes, you deliver a competent fully functional project at the end of your 16 weeks of running.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Then… we have certificate of participation say for example for whichever reasons you were not able to do a fully functional project and you are not able to deliver a pitch deck so you but you are active on the rms very active

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And you follow through all the modules, you completed them 100%. Remember, as you study the module.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:43.000
It will show you the percentage you've covered. Okay so assuming we've covered all the modules to an extent of 100 um This certificate is meant to acknowledge your commitment in learning.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Even if you do not meet any additional evaluation criteria. So… The only thing that it doesn't do, it does not grant you access to current hub or job opportunities so this one after you are done We say thank you for participating

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
God bless you and happy future. Okay yes so that is how it goes.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:31.000
So for achievement you are required to have a fully functional project a pitch deck, recognition level that it means you have an outstanding performance And it will also give you access to parent hub and job boxes so it's required for you to be able to progress

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000
For participation, all you need is commitment. In learning. Okay.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Yes. So that is it. And make sure that you are able to progress on every module 100%.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And you are good. That one will give you but it's a certificate of participation.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:21.000
When we go to project evaluation criteria now for those, I hope most of you and I hope all of you will go for project certificate of achievement So that guys you get placed for jobs Okay, yes, those jobs are for you, 3,000 plus jobs are for you.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Okay, so make sure you do that you join in so that you can be able to Grab yourself a job.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
So when you deliver a project, we check one on code quality.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
What's the quality of your quote? You run what's called quality as you progress.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Okay. Documentation. We'll check on how you've documented your solution the quality of your pitch deck.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000
How will organize your pitch deck. You learn how to organized pitch decks.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Kia very nicely and swiftly. The innovations and problem-solving skills you have shown in your problem we check your user experience.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Engagements with your project that is the software product you're creating And we will also check conversion control. Mostly we do this using GitHub.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:37.000
So for you to be able to progress in this module, whether you with get a certificate of achievement participation you must have a github account.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:55.000
So through GitHub account we can be able to check on your commitment and the commits the type of engagements you've made with your projects so that we can know that for sure this is your project.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And these ones we are very keen, especially for those groups projects. You can't claim to be doing a group project. Mostly group projects will involve five or less between three to five people.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Now you can't claim to be doing a group project And you've done nothing. You have zero commits.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:43.000
For that project on your github So we will check to certify that if you're saying this is a group project Then you've already participated you've already done enough and you've done your work in the group project we check that.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Okay. Yes. And I think that's a good thing that you can be able to do project as a group.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
It's a beautiful thing yeah you can be able to present as a copy.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Group of three to five. Maximum. Cool.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000
And finally… we do reach out to you guys.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Just in case we really arise, you've not been able to log in to the rms Because I've told you that learning here happens on the elements. So if you realize that you've not been able to attend classes, live classes or even

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Check on rms we might reach out to you through the contacts info you've given us that is email for phone calls, texts.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Maybe WhatsApp chats And just see whether we can help you to catch up and to come maybe to be able to come back to the running process.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Okay. Yes. So we can reach out to you And then reach outs happen once per month.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Not everyone here and then but mostly as command. Okay.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:10.000
So you'll be having pitching sessions You'll be thrown out of picture projects.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Definitely. From week nine i think there so And then… What you'll do your first project do project submissions and evaluations and the selection of the top projects begins once you are done with your final project.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Then we have group pitching guide So just in case you want to pitch as a group.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
We have a special guide for you how it is done as a group.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
We have presentations. To the entrepreneurship team.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:57.000
That is the first team you pitch to. They will check they quality of your pitch deck product and so forth and then they will may be varied edits.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Maybe to go to the next step whereby you have one-on-one pitching guide as well.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And then there is the presentation to PRP management team And after that they will select the PRP management team will select the top three best projects And those top three best projects are awarded during graduation.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
And you're given cash. Cash bids in dollars.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Okay, nice cash pizza. I think the first project last year one was given i think twelve thousand dollars What can you do with $12,000?

00:33:41.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Just for doing your work. Okay, I think that's good money so yeah I hope the money will still remain the same so yeah there's a cash bid for you you'll be given a gift you'll be gifted. I wanted that your project is among the top three

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:15.000
All right. So make sure you do the river a good competent projects so that one you don't miss out the cash I think 12,000 can really come in handy.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Doras can really come in handy. Wow. Yeah. You know.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:28.000
In such a in such a in such a project competence competition Okay, that's good.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Then there is the graduation part. So our graduation is virtual.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
It happens light show. After we must do that assessment and certification.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:57.000
So we check on class attendance. We check on the farro's active participation project completion, master classes and bootcups and town halls and pitch deck submission. We'll check on all that Yes.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Allow me to speak about the pharaohs. If you ever check on the pharaoh.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Maybe for any reason you are not able to continue with the Lanning.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000
You can defer. But deferring means you it will affect your future eligibility.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Scholarship you cannot be considered for any future scholarship. Because it means you when you are given that opportunity you didn't… maximize on it.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:41.000
And so we can't trust that even if you're given it again you will be able to utilize it Okay. Yes. So… That's how it can affect your progress.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:50.000
So… We have a talent department that checks on you once you finish the course.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:06.000
It gives a nice assessment and a complete project, Photoshop CV and check all the boxes that You've got already ticks and then they craft a pitch deck for you so that you can be able to do an elevation pitch to

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Industrial employers and yeah help you in job placement.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Help all of you get to that department Yes, we hope to transition our view.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:32.000
So… if you don't participate, if you lack active participation in the program.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:49.000
You will be dropped off. You will be dropped off That means we theorize that you are not attending classes you are not accessing the elements So what, however, just happen will just be dropped off.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:58.000
And you'll be discontinued from the program. And you will not be accepted in future cohorts.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Sponsorship. Okay. I had already talked about the ferments.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Yes, so there it is. And like I said, if you defer It might affect it will directly affect your future eligibility feature scholarship and sponsorship.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Okay, so that is it.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000
And how is that? So that is why we are here.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And I hope everybody got it clear as to why we are here.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:46.000
All right. Yes. Now that's it.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:56.000
I can now progress. How shall we be here? Let me progress to how Shall we be here?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:05.000
So that is that. So let me first give you a break so that you can zip your coffee.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:24.000
I know I've given you a lot of information Yeah, so just for the reads yeah I'll come to your questions at the end of your After this, shortly after this address all the questions so keep them posted on the Q&A section.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:36.000
I might not be able to follow up the chat, so make sure you maximize on the Q&A section. I think I'll be able to follow up that.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Okay, nice. So how should we be here so we will be here by attending classes on the rms So this is the error message so basically on the rms the first part is my learning.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
So my learning, you should see the modules that are accessible to you.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:09.000
For example, at this point, you should only have one module that is software engineering only.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
The rest will appear. And they will unfold as you progress.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Okay, so after two weeks you have access to database, entrepreneurship and personal development skills.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Web technologies, Python. And such you get as you progress when you go to specialization based on your specialization you have access to other modules like AI for software engineering full stack web development with managed software testing and such.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
So that is that that is And that and fat as well.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.000
So but as for now So the only module you should be able to see is software engineering.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Yes. Soft Age Engineering. Okay, so there you go is where you get the response. So you click on software engineering you'll see there are two types. There is curriculum you click on day one, you'll be able to see day one

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.000
For example, reason one how to use the rms It's very nice lesson.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:44.000
The aim of this lesson is just to, the lesson we are learning today It's basically to help you run through the RMS. There are some videos nice videos you can watch on how to work on the rms And everything, for example, we can see

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
How to work on peer to peer as a group

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Hello, this is how you access the peer-to-peer review feature on the LMS system. On the left navigation menu, select My Groups.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Under my groups, select your designated group, which will be listed under my groups page. This will navigate you to a page with features such as your group name, submissions, and peer-to-peer review feature.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:23.000
On the peer-to-peer review page, you'll find options such as the group name, the submitted file, the rating and ad review. View the submitted file for which you are making a review for.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:31.000
And then make a review of the file on the add review option.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
So we give you that opportunity. You'll be having opportunity to run as groups.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:56.000
So you can be able to work as groups. On maybe assignments, you have assignments that you can work on as a groups We call them peer-to-peer groups. So you'll be grouped uh soon So to access peer groups, you just need to check on groups the groups

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Option you find your group there And most three varies.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Group members i was up rink where you can be able to link up with those group members and i believe that has already been done already you should be in Kodena kia group.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And yeah, making sure that you are running together. It's for easy learning.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000
That's it. After my learning we have Passport.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Dashboard, you check on your progress. Mostly, for example.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Oh. Just in case.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
This message appears rewrote. Maybe it tells you it couldn't load significantly.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Just the road temp page it should be him well for example you will get the progress of every module you are on for example Let me check on my software engineering.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Can see uh progress 80%. Okay, cool. So there are things I need to do, forget?

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:25.000
So for you to get a certification, a certificate of participation you should at least finish all these modules up to 100%.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:36.000
That's cool. It will give you the progress that's why we have dashboard just for you to be able to see the progress you'll also see the reader board see on the reader board, you get to see who is leading

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:46.000
In terms of LMS usage. Okay. Some of you are here today, maybe it's your first time to log in the RMS.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Vms was open for you guys on Friday. And on Friday evening, I remember there is a student who emailed me.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
And ask me how to progress to week Five, assignment.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I don't know how fast she was. Able to navigate through the rms i think she was waiting for it to be open Once the door was opened, she went through, dido the assignment And I think she got some challenges and I helped her.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Be able to overcome that challenge. So basically that's it so there's there are people you realize there are people who do very much on the RMS. So every activity you do on the RMS is like a connect And because it's recorded.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:48.000
It's given an award. Given an alert so like given what if you are first one like this guy here for these cohort.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
You'll receive a badge. Free badge of being there on the reader board for the LMS.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Okay. Yes, you can see my score is quite down. I need to improve.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:07.000
On how I'm using my NMS. Poof, cool. Oh, I need to walk hunt.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Okay, cool. So if your rms score is very down buck had to be a very doubted.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Okay, and so that you can receive those badges. Okay, so that is dashboard.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:37.000
It shows you your progress. You'll be able to see your progress Again, on the dashboard you'll see the events you see the events So assuming there is an upcoming event, it will be uploaded here. You'll see the event details here on the events part.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Thank you. Okay. Now, after dashboard there is cross sessions I don't know how you logged into today's class, but I hope you It's my hope that you came you're logged in through the crash session on the rms Because… Like I've said, your usage of the rms your activities on the rms is recorded and it's your rewarded points.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Okay, so to increase your points, always make sure that you log in every class using the rms So if you want to attend a class it's very easy. You just need to click maybe on Like today is 24th so i think

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:43.000
I can just book here. If I want to book tomorrow's class, I can just click here I can be able to click here and register to join okay you register maybe you should register before 12 hours before class. From 12 hours you can

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Go ahead and register. Yes, so that's how you are able to join classes.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Make sure you join classes for EMS. That's it.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:19.000
We have the other part of submissions. So maybe you have submitted quiz and results after you have submitted you can be able to see and you will quiz the results. Unfortunately, I don't think have I don't think I've submitted any

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
I don't think so. I've not submitted these. So there is no data for me.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000
No data that can be Let me see. Does software development claim.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:42.000
I don't think there is anything for me there. But if maybe you submitted also assignment you will see the assignments you've submitted here.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:58.000
You'll be able to see the assignment. Submitted so for example Let me show you how to submit assignments. So you just go to my learning.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Let me see. Let me check for our module of notes and load because i know for software engineering I've been loads Okay, let me just use software engineering.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000
It's okay. So there you go.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Oh.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Let's go to day one assignment. The one assignment.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:41.000
There is the assignment. I'm there i'm on the assignment. So you'll talk to follow instructions provided the dead drying is on March that 1, 25, 2025.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:49.000
So make sure that by March that one you are done with all the software engineering essentials

00:48:49.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Assignments and you're done. Okay so there are some good instructions of how to uh how Like… be able to go around They… assignments, all right?

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
So you read those instructions And after reading the instructions.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:23.000
You go ahead now and do the assignment. So you can click here click here light creek once you write creek say open lights.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Link in a new tab, open link in a new tab there you go And it should open up and ask you to accept. Once you accept you should find this Okay. You should find a GitHub laptop So click on that GitHub rep where you find

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:55.000
The reason why you have seen that for me it has not prompted me to accept is because i've accepted the I've accessed this assignment before.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
You'll get so click on the githubo.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000
So you need a GitHub account. Before you attempt an assignment.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000
You need a GitHub account. And you don't have to worry. I'll show you how to create one. It's very easy.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000
You don't have to worry. You don't have to struggle. Creating a GitHub account.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:30.000
So once you're on your github account repo all you need to do is make sure you For example.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Oh.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Make sure you are on that level. And once you are on the level That is software the one project the it's.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Just edit edit this Lead me. This lead me fire.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Is the one you edit. Okay see here there is a prompting you open in Visual Studio Code. You can do that no problem But I think the most important thing is just a bit Edit these software uh this lead me

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Answer the questions. You see there are questions here. Answer them in your best Norridge plausible and then commits. Once you commit and save commit these changes.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Just click your code. And check for HTTPS.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Copy the URL. All right copy the URL.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:42.000
All right. And once you copy the URL.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Just going… paste it at the submission part.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:58.000
And it's that easy to submit an assignment. Okay, you just Press it there and submit.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Now. It is possible for example sometimes to light crickering the ring.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:27.000
And instead of giving you it or instead of it redirecting you to For example, the way you've seen I've right clicked open in a new tab I found a nice lepo that has got good information It is possible that this level you click here, it's possible for you to be directed in unnamed teleport.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:43.000
An empty report is a report that has nothing. Okay, so don't worry in case that happens just right click here there is so that's that's why it is that is function if we direct it to an empty repository follow these instructions below.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000
So you link you right click open in a new tab.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:58.000
So this one, it will give you a document that has the question, the same questions you would have found on the GitHub.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Report okay so copy all these questions You can just… Copy. All right.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:17.000
And once you copy You can even answer fast answer the questions and copy then copy paste.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:26.000
You piss them on a readme file. You just come here and now on the empty Lippo you can add a new file.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.000
You can add a new file just add a new file And on that new file that should be added to me.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
So that… I don't need me fire.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:54:00.000
And on that lead me fire make sure make sure. Oh, I've not signed in. That's why it cannot be able to okay Let me save one so that you can be able to see.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Okay. So cool. So cool.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
So you can add a new file. Just add a new file.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Create a new fire make sure it's already domain copy paste your work there Okay, just paste. Let's assume you're pasting copy paste your work there and then commit okay and once you commit you make sure you give your fire a name. Maybe you call it assignments

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Assignment. Whatever maybe assignment one or day one assignment That's true.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Let's call it day one. Day one assignment.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
And dot md the markdown.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Noctivity okay Then I can commit the changes.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Okay. That's all you can commit the changes.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:20.000
And that's all you see? So that is what you do. Here it is. So the assignment will be creativity here. I've created it that was an assumption Like the way I've studied, assuming you are open an empty lepo that's how you go about it.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:39.000
You create a new And you make sure that you just create a new file and add it to your repo to that repo that you've found empty. But if they empty the foul lepo is not empty, there has an assignment like this one just cricket it

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Type your answers. To the best of your knowledge for example And maybe once you're done.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Commits, changes. And once you commit changes.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000
You're good.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Then you can just come here at code. Make sure it's on HTTPS, not SSH.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Or GitHub CRI just that. And then copy the url all right copy the URL.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:48.000
And then go to PRP Academy, submit. And then submit you paste the submit and then submit okay Para de venta you realize Sorry, a minute.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Okay so para de Venture you have entered the long maybe submission at your submission level first submission you submitted the wrong link you can just go to your Oh.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Github Lepo correct pick the correct link and then once you pick the correct rink come here at submissions And then assignment submission. Check on the assignment that you submitted wrongly.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:45.000
And then a date, click a date you can change the link And then updates. You just need to maybe like delete that link.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000
And then you paste the new rink that you think is correct then updates.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:01.000
That the assignment link will be updated successfully. It's that easy.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:23.000
I hope that clears the AI on how to submit assignment how to correct assignment links and how to make sure that you update your assignment links just in case you submitted along or repo assignment now note you must have a GitHub account for you to be able to attempt an assignment

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:30.000
You just need to go to github.com. And GitHub.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Dot com.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Not dashboard, just dot com it will sign into my dashboard let me sign out.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:51.000
So that you can see what you will see if it's your first time to see GitHub.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Okay. So there i go this is what you find.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:10.000
In the beginning. Just say sign up for github Okay. And just create an account just like the way you create an email account or any other online account you'll be told to test whether you are a robot, make sure you

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Verify you are not a robot. And you'll be good.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:31.000
All right. It's going to be pretty cool. Maybe you and don't struggle you should not struggle to create a github account just go to youtube dot com.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Maybe for easy for easy throw i've told you struggle struggling we left it to our dependent our forefathers who are struggling for our independent So nowadays we don't struggle. There is information for anything you want to do.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:57.000
So just say creating our GitHub account.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Github. I couldn't.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Creating a GitHub account Okay. Yeah. So there is very many videos to show you how to create with github account even how to use GitHub.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Okay. Yes. And how to work around github Yeah, so yes so do not struggle. Do not struggle in any way.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Okay. Yes. All right. That's it. Hopefully by tomorrow, make sure you have a GitHub account or by after this make sure you have a GitHub account.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And you can be able to submit the assignment.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:01:02.000
All right after that there is the community tab Now on the community tab you can get to connect with other people All right. And you can get to connect with other people who have been in the peer academic program.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Okay. Yes. And you can comment, you can cheer others, you can for example help I'm Tony Mondicchi who is asking has anyone successfully registered for today's class and you can comment Yes, I have.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Yes. Okay. Cool. So you see so That's it. Maybe if somebody knows you, for example, you can see somebody asking told him to use Google meet maybe there is somebody who knows antony madicki He has seemed to use Google Mint.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Okay, I don't know which kind of class is that. Maybe behavior across on Google, they could happen.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Okay.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:03.000
If you have made any posts you check here on what have you posted.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Fortunately, I've posted nothing so far so good. Okay, yes.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:17.000
These account is just to help you to understand Rana.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.000
The learner perspective, actually. I don't use this. I use my admin account so Mary, will I post anything?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Okay. That's cool. So that is that interact with the community The more you interact with the community, the more you earn more rewards points. That really helps.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Gain reward points. Finally, but not least, but we have gemini tab This is the tab that I hope you will interact with most.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Because it is very helpful in when it comes to like walking around

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:19.000
In the rms so especially for your assignments you can always connect with gemini And with the light prompts it can help you to successfully to your assignment well.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Okay. Yes. So it's a good tool. And also notes maybe there is something you've read and you've not understood well say for example you are on my learning and some something was just mentioned belief free maybe like for example you find

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Something like… software project management was highlighted and you are like, what is that? Then you can just come here Ask Gemini, what is software project management?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It will give you nice details of what is software project management and Gemini will never be mad at you to tell you, oh, you've asked me too many questions.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yeah, Mr. Gemini is a good one. Who will always answer your queries as they come through.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Hope you interact with Gemini more. Finally, we have the certificates part whereby if you have any certificates they will be posted here.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:36.000
All right yeah they'll be posted here And you will enjoy the certificates. Any certificates you have, maybe you've participated in a power hack or hackathons.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:53.000
You will see that as certificates updated there or maybe you've uh completed your session you have a certificate of participation it should appear there or certificate of achievement it should appear there. Good.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Also, now here there is some more information about Um.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Your cohort For example, this was for Safaricum who called channel for so for you as it should be leading feb 2025 cohort? Yes.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Oh, God. I think God, since you have not long.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Yeah. So that is the LMS.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Concerning your…

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Your rms profile you can set it the way you want But… not very necessary, though.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Even if you leave some parts and updated no problem it will never affect your progress But it is good to make sure you update this sector.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Up to this amount make sure you can update For the final project, you update the ring Once you… start your final project okay All right. The rest you can upgrade as you wish.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Cool. That's cool. Um… But remember, the more you like engage with elements the better the points. So for better points make sure you feel like all of this.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It's beautiful. Okay. That's it.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Now let's check a few things.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.000
On my learning a few things on my learning So we've checked on how to do assignments.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:15.000
We've checked on events. So at least you know what's event notification there will be notification most three of you download content Okay. Yeah, that is your download content, mostly.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:25.000
That's when notification comes in or if there is a new message on community that concerns you to have a mention to be updated there.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:33.000
So let's say for example We've read this lesson. You see this lesson is being recorded.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So where will you find the recordings of this lesson? You just need to come at day one for example and check for a restaurant that has your cohort name recording for example You can see here we have Safari kombucha's recordings. Leave that that does not belong to you.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
It was for them okay we go to lesson five.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Feb cohort, Feb 2025 cohort recordings click on that. That's where your recordings are now you'll find there is, for example, the live class morning session This was a recorded class this is the recorded version of the class that happened in the morning.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
It's always good to check. You might find that Even though all crusts are similar.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Okay, maybe there's something I said in the morning But I have not said in this class okay or maybe there's something I've said in this class But I didn't say in the morning or that I will say in the evening.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:51.000
There could be one or two or more variations. So you can check for your own good So for you to be able to view the recordings, click on the live class right click all the rings on the rms you have to right click they are not

01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:03.000
They don't operate by clicking. You have to right click. Open maybe So once you open copy this passcode. Okay.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
You have to copy it. Because you'll be asked for it.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I think I had accessed it. If it's your first time to access it.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.000
You'll be asked for a passcode so make sure you copy it and give it for you to be able to view.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:25.000
But for me, I think I had accessed it i had to test it whether it was working before I came to class.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
So that's why it has just opened. So then you pray the recording.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
You can be able to navigate. On the rms simply because At P.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And… you can as you can see it's So don't don't cut me.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And in case you are asked for as account type choose student.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000
By checking my recordings are not working. They are working as you can see they are working okay yeah so everything is working well.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Things are not uploaded in Google Drive format they are uploaded in This is a zone crowds so it is

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Cool. That is. That is how you should be able to access recordings just in case you miss cross it also works good for you.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:10.000
If you want to now the best thing about deal with this recording download it to your machine local machine why LMS is a dynamic platform, as you can see.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
And so things keep on changing Okay, things keep on changing.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So for your better access of such recordings. Download them and because they are very long you see like this decoding is around two hours even not long He has 1 hour 51 minutes.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
That's quite a long record, isn't it? So watch it on net.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Maybe it might if you are using Buddles you will struggle but if you're not using burdos, we're good But for future accessibility.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:11:00.000
You know as time goes for example i think in the morning we tried to access the shook recordings and they were not available after one month or so the recordings will be deleted. They are not there forever.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Okay, we are just there to help you to catch up.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Okay, so it's assumed that after one month you have catched up everything you wanted to catch up.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
So just in case for future reference of your own you can download.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000
You can just download there is always this button download.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So download them download the recordings so that you can enjoy them even offline Okay. Yes. It's easier that way.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Yeah, and after you after one month, they will be deleted. They will not be available after one month so Yeah. Cool.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So far, so good. That said.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Also on the Oh.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
For example, on the

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:08.000
So for example, now we access software engineering the first this kind of the first lesson of your module.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Change. Nice. Coron, where you are.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:24.000
So you can see there is the restaurant content Okay. And this content is accessible. If you want to run this code.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You must install an SDK. Like vs code okay where you don't have to worry what's VS Code just go to your Browser.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Check for VS code. Me is good.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Simple. Yes, Kodak. You will learn how to install this tomorrow. So today I will not go into details of installation i'll just go to show you where you can find it Download the VS Code model of your choice but that is not what I want. You can click download button

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.000
So if you click download button you should be able to see.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Models either is for Windows or Linux or mac download and be happy.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Install then you can copy and learn that could they could for the good term you need a vs code Yes, you need VS code. You won't learn just like that.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Okay, copy the code on yes code and learn it. It will learn.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Also, you might need, for example, this is a python code If I'm not long.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And since this is a Python code. Mostly the codes here are pi bond, actually.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:59.000
The codes here, most of them are pylon So for you to be able to run You will also need to install Python.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Okay, so come here and type python Just don't struggle. I told you there is no struggle. We don't struggle nowadays okay Python, welcome to python.og. Yeah, nice.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Come here to downloads download for your downloads windows uh either windows or mac if you are onlinex you don't have to worry Python comes installed in Linux by default.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Okay. Yes. Where even in Windows, Pybomb comes installed But it is good to install this one.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:49.000
For reasons I will tell you later. On day three as we will tomorrow maybe i will tell you tomorrow So today, let me not dive into that. Okay.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:56.000
So you can download and install. That is that. Um for you for that code to run.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Okay, I'm just telling you just in case you want to test that codec? Yes.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Primarily, that's how you go around that. Now, there is downloading the content for example you want to download this content There is the download content button you click on it it will send you an email.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000
A mirror with download details. On your email okay download content.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So that is that. But also.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:53.000
There could be sorry Also, there could be additional resources for example You see this link it has an additional link uh resources for example introduction to software engineering right click on it.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Open link on a new tab it will directly read you to guide you to the presentation.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Representation on software engineering

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So it's very key you note that most of the resources to access extra resources within the URL, you right click there don't try clicking they will not respond they are not responsible just uh one greek And that is to ensure that you are not boggled, you know, boggled by

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Anything that you meet that needs to be clicked okay Yeah, the focus is to make it easier. The reason why we make sure that you can only right click to get a result It means that you need to you are at that point when you need badly sauce.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Okay. Yes. So make your work easier. So that's that.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.000
There is always a video. Some lessons have video content not or I've just said not my words.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Some lessons, video content. Like I think this one should have video content.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Yeah. Why is it not getting it? It should get it.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Let me see.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Awesome content. Did you get the rest on

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:51.000
So at times you can fight get these challenges just make sure you restart your reading You can just…

01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Reset the browser it will work. Towards restarting computing works wonders most of the time

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:11.000
For example it's it was refusing just after restarting. It's working now.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:34.000
So after refreshing you see it's working you can always refresh the browser if it gives you that message, that error message, oh, content what just rogue in case it persists log out log in again it will work okay such problems are expected. So you'll find a video like this one this one will

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Is a video. A restaurant video for just to explain to you what the restaurant is all about.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Okay. Yes. And it's important.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:58.000
You can download it as well. And… Yeah. And be watching offline no problem.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Right. That's cool. That's it.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So you can be able to check all that. Any queries so far so good?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Think of it's print. Everything about navigation, quizzes Any living assignments i've touched on them Now it's very important to understand every aspect of the LMS.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Because this is where burning happens. So let me see your queries.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:40.000
On the Q&As. So go to Q&As.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I'll be able to see all your carries.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Somebody is saying ciders hack. Hakuziman. Okay, hakuzimana.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:27.000
You're saying that I'm now able to log in, but my names are not corrected yet. My name's Silah Hakuana. Okay.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:33.000
So Sila, for that. You can lay the ticket.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:42.000
We are not able to change your names on the profile Just leave the ticket for that. It's a technical issue.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Laser ticket for that i had already How do we get PRP cohort teragram link?

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Ah, it's there on the… I believe it's telegram link.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Where do you get it? That one, I'm not. Let me see whether I can. I don't know whether I can be able to share or invite you I'm not pretty sure. I'm on telegraph. Maybe somebody should guide me.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:20.000
On how to share territory i rarely use telegraph myself. Um… But I'm trying.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I'm really trying. View channel info in full.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Let me see. Okay.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I don't know how you share. Honestly, I'm there, but I don't know how to share the link.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So maybe some somebody can tell me how to do that or if you're in paragram you can try share the link on the… On the… Under what on the chat that's okay try that you will help your colleagues here. Somebody's stuck

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Sorry to disturb. May I have how reacted life crisis seems 80% of them are mandatory.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:40.000
How to attend is very easy. I already explained that you attend a rive class by going to cross sessions Um… and then you book you you register simple Yeah. The cross sessions are open 12 hours before.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:53.000
So you can register as early as 12 hours before and then just wait to join okay for example Oh.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Here there is no crash sessions for today. Uh huh.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I don't know. Okay.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Bishop because sessions have changed. I think it's because… Now, in case you should see con sessions like of daily they are updated they are updated good and great conversations.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Okay, then we'll try to refresh my and see whether i'll get one

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I am not there. So here you will see all the crash sessions that you have. For example.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
On your ends this is not your God, this is Safarcom.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:24:00.000
But on your cohort, you should be able to see Safari come this week uh not safari com but software engineering essentials the cohorts up to Friday.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You get so you just pick one for example like that And then… that one is already added. So let's assume you are entering that or let's assume you are going for this that with pattern you just need to click here to register and join.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Okay, that's good. Is that easy? Okay, I hope that one sort your question out.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
All right. Another one is asking

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Oh. What application will be coding on?

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I've just explained application will be coding is VS Code. Yes, VS Code.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Can someone have two sessions a day? Yes, you can enter in even though they're dream there is no it should actually it will be an additional point for you you'll be rewarded better.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.000
What's a beach deck? Can someone be awarded both certificate is successful or just one?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:21.000
You just get one based on what you did. If you provide a The pitch deck is just a presentation of your project.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Simple i've said you'll be taking how through how to create one Then you can only be given certificate of achievement if you deliver a fully functional project and a pitch deck.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:58.000
That's when you get a certificate of achievement. You don't have that but you have participated through the process and you committed yourself to 100% completion of every module you get certificate of participation or not both.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:15.000
That's cool. When we reset up GitHub today as early as today, I think I've explained that you need a github account But tomorrow you'll have a live session of setting up one just in case you are not able to set by your own

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:25.000
But as I've explained to you, you should be able to set up one by your own Yes, very easy.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:45.000
We have… events where we hear from professionals who have specialized in the field we want to specialize yes of the spring that's that's the reason why we have master classes Chibonso okay that's why we have master classes we invite professionals

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Who are already practicing in the field and they talk to you.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And that's all about master classes. Oh.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Teragram link maybe you can ask from your friends i i really don't have an access to one currently I think I don't know how to share one. I wish I knew I could have helped you.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:17.000
But ask your friends to share on the chat. Maybe somebody should share on the chat a Telegram link how to join.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Have zero ideas personnel. Why am I not able to access group telegram at home?

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
A moment, I'm sorry. You should check.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:41.000
There is an invitation link you got. You should have gotten an email with an invitation link to all that to Oh, wow.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Telegram channel and the rms I hope you got one.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
What do you mean drop off by not attending classes or accessing module?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Yeah, if you are not accessing cross modules. And you are not, that is the life cross like we are having today Currently. And you are not also logging into RMS.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Okay. Then you'll be dropped off. And you'll be discontinued from the program.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Completely. Yes.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But before you are dropped off, there will be a reach out to you to tell you you should come back So maybe you also don't respond to a phone an email a phone call or a text when we have no option but to discontinue you.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:54.000
No. Apart from group project, will everyone be required to present his own project no it's if you are in a group project that is the final project. That's what I'm saying.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:00.000
You will present as a group Okay, so there'll be no issue with that.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
But if you are an individual, you present as an individual.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Okay. Yes. Oh, mm-hmm.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:29.000
On GitHub be supported by phone, not one get an account which apps to use on phone Like I said, phone bookacha you can use lab kit on phone But it is limited. Note, the print is limited but you can use lip treats.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Github you can have a github there's a github app on the phone but it is also limited in terms of operation compared to desktop.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Okay, so make sure you have one on your laptop or desktop yes Okay.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Oh. Oh. How will we be able to show that one has done for us Like I said, anything you do on the rms it's recorded.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So if you are for example studying using the rms and it's recorded.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
So why do not? Oh.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And there is an assignment I should submit. Yes, I've already shown the assignment.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And how to go about it so in case you didn't get that part After class, make sure you watch this video have explained how to go to assignment and be able to sort out assignments.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Okay, cool. So I'm checking for a new question.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Very regulated by clicking the link.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:33.000
And you can create your own credentials burial Yeah, it's very dangerous to Just like have access to LMS without credentials so create your own credentials Don't put it open. It's dangerous.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Somebody can hack your LMS. Yeah, and it means the other people might be able to use it if they access your email okay Yes. Comfreeti Jenna.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Oh. Is it possible to do two modules given, I'm able to pursue them.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:14.000
No, you want to choose one. But what it is not restricted you can attend the classes for other modules. There is no restrictions to add that. You can attend the classes for other modules.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And you can also develop a project in them so there is no problem but for specialization you choose one But if you want knowledge on other modules it's available. Just attend the class.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Do the projects they are given wearing goods okay Yes, but specialization or no one how is cross attendance But very easy if you just attended, it means you had registered.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:56.000
And so that registration was registered on Zoom. And Zoom helps us to analyze your data for all the attendance, the attendees who did attend today's class.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Yes. Yes. So… we get very easily as well.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Also, if you attended using your rms and you clicked on the class session by a cross session reads also very easy to enter because after they session zoom will tell me how many Students, why both log in as all your details

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000
They hit a missile as well. Okay, chlorium kwana.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Is it normal that I have absolutely no study materials on my EMS? No, it's abnormal.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You should have at least on my learning there should be one module that is software engineering essentials this one software engineering So in case that's the case then laser ticket. I said, you just come here raise a ticket do your name your email your number

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Your category of issue maybe you say content issue because you don't have content and then uh continue give it a subject you don't have maybe anything on my rms and then explain a bit give a simple explanation of your rms you can even screenshot to show

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Better okay and then raise the issue. I think I showed that before.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:34.000
So it's not normal. Let me see any other question on Here.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:44.000
How can someone access the day one assignment because there is no link to the assignment or submission link The restaurant took the day the same.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:55.000
So… So you can see if once you've got software engineering essentials you go to day one.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Part of Press on five.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Day one. There is the quiz, the survey, and the last part is assignment, day one assignment.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:24.000
That's how you access it. Just in case your RMS does not have maybe she has the rest on day one day to raise a ticket Okay. Yes.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:31.000
The restaurants we are attending are all the same like what we are doing in this lesson is what we did in the morning.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Okay. Yeah, so… just choose to attend one.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Don't struggle to attach flies not unless maybe you enjoyed the craft so much and maybe you want to enjoy the same maybe zockey.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:53.000
But the content is the same. Who makes the groups?

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000
The groups will be assigned Eventually.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000
You are assigned groups. By the end of the moon, ma'am.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Just like the way you are given login access the same way.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I should go to Chris.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I've been convincing new class. How do I connect Nigerian group members

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I think you're in Nigeria.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Um… in your groupings you'll be grouped as linking the groupings, I'm not very sure how you are grouped.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:37:04.000
The criteria might not be that you are from the same country But maybe you can reach out and see whether there is a WhatsApp group you can Okay, we encourage you guys you can use any means of communication you can you want

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:26.000
But the best way would go via telegram. Go via telegram and check whether there is Are we, are we a way of checking um For example… ask the discuss group on the discuss group ask connect with members from your country

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I think they can be able to connect from there. You can even offer I was up maybe rank and they can be able to join from there that that can happen Okay. Yes.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:48.000
All right. That's it. A hole is closeted and checked.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I've trunked. I think I've already explained that babo chambole Some classes collage with my invest how can i access director data?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:06.000
I've already shown that just in case you've missed the lecture you just need to go to My learning.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Check on… class lesson varies.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Maybe day one, for example, check on There is a reason for your recordings like for example for you it will always be fab 2025 cohort recordings check there and there you'll find the recording you'll find the record in event

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Lesson will be posted there afterwards. For example, you can see the morning class is already posted you can be able to Light Creek.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:52.000
And logging and enjoy. Make sure you use the passcode.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.000
To access the view. Without that passcode you cannot access the view.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:09.000
All right. So that is how you do it. Oh, mm-hmm.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:17.000
So you sign in how do you sign in for cross attendance you just need to go to crash sessions pre-condition.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:32.000
And then there will always be a choice of For example, if I click here you can see there is cricket register and join the session That's how you do it.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Okay. I'm very relieved. I'm asking your questions. Thank you for your time.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I want to focus on our own long pipeline. Oh.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Yeah.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Yeah, I said, uh. Currently, the only module you should be able to see is software engineering.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:30.000
The rest will appear as you continue. For example, others like python we love peer after two weeks.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.000
So software engineering will only go for two weeks, 10 days actually.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And the content is arranged in five days. Every day has at least two restaurants.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Yeah. So make sure you check that. And let me check for a question that I've not answered.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:41:06.000
The program is self-paced. You should be able to be free to lead at your own pace but we will explain a few concepts here and there. You can also always ask questions.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It's expected that before you come to Christ, you've already covered by yourself whatever is on the on the rms and you can be able to ask questions and interact with your readings, Rata.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Okay, what is that celebration? Accreditation.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:46.000
The prudence Kadura. Oh.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:42:04.000
The certification you get in prp is globally recognized Yeah, it's strawberry and coconut. Think of it as a certificate like the one you do in microsoft or the one you do in maybe Oracle because it shows us skill.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Okay. Yes. I think that is that.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Joy Prudence. Uh… Is it mandatory for one today?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:32.000
To do the day one quiz immediately after day one classes or one can do it any other day. It all depends on how first you want to move well curved seed, for example.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I give an example. There was this student who called me on Friday. On Friday, once you were given the login access that night a student called me not quote but emailed me And she told me that she was already on day four

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:58.000
And she wanted to go to day five Because it's self-paced it's you to determine how you occur.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:11.000
All right so you can do it immediately you can wait The only thing is that you cannot be able to move to next week's content without having done the quizzes and the surveys and the assignments.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
One day. Okay.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Oh. Check your email check your internet if your rms is not loading check your internet

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:55.000
The recordings are live after class. I'm checking for a new Query.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Pitch checks everything you do is virtual even pitch deck It's virtual. We don't have physical classes Yeah.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:25.000
So somebody is telling me, have groups been informed are confirmed that you i don't know. I don't have access to your cohorts like content like the way I have, I've told you what I have here is what was for Safari.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000
So check out whether your groups have been formed. I am not fully aware of that.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:45.000
So I'm not in a position to answer that. Hmm.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:45:05.000
No, the restaurants are not continuation each lesson is a repetition of what have been happening the whole day so choose only one

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:11.000
There is no Say, for example, we have a hackathon.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Power huck. Power hack. They are called powerham.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:25.000
So if you have a power hug session then for that you have to travel say for example we say we have power hug at UON.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
If you need to participate in that you can you have to travel.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:41.000
You get but layered we have such Most of the hackathons are virtual. Most sort of hackathons are virtual, but at times we can have a powerhouse.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Which maybe it's done a specific place mostly that's when you might need to travel but larry like last cohort we didn't have one We discourage such because we want you guys to two things come virtually.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:20.000
And since our program is virtual. We realized that that program is not really good for our students. So what we have is coffee and cold sessions, those are the only physical things. If you want to travel, wear and good. So for example, if you have

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:27.000
We have for example we have upcoming on feb 28 We have a coffee and cold events.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Awful. Suicidal oats.
