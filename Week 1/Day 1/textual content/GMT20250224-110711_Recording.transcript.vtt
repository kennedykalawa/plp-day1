00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:16.619
PLP Academy: or we can also now, check on, what is the Lms like, why are we here? Okay.

72
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:22.169
PLP Academy: so first, st we are here because we want to learn software engineering.

73
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:32.069
PLP Academy: Okay, so basically, what that means. You will be equipped with software development issues.

74
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.989
PLP Academy: skills, not issues but skills. You'll be equipped with software development skills.

75

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.710
PLP Academy: you can also be able to

81
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:28.480
PLP Academy: login as specialized as an AI machine learning develop

82
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.399
PLP Academy: cool. So you can be an AI engineer after this.

83
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.980
PLP Academy: So our main model of communication

84
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:43.980
PLP Academy: for easy communication to your to you learners, we use telegram. So I hope you have a telegram app

85
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.789
PLP Academy: like this one mine installed in your phone. Or.

86
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:56.190
PLP Academy: yeah, the reason why we use telegram because it's easy to use. And mostly you find that.

PLP Academy: It's it's it's allows.

89
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:25.780
PLP Academy: A lot of people, a lot of groups, large groups, organizations. So, for example, you can see, Feb. 2025 cohort announcements have around 6,001, 33 subscribers. So that's a right number. Whatsapp cannot hold that. So we end up using telegram. It favors as it can hold up to 10,000. So we are. We're covered by telegram.

PLP Academy: there is the runner selection criteria that was followed. How did you come here? How did you make it here. So first, st

118
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.629
PLP Academy: we checked in the application form

119
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:29.259
PLP Academy: whether you 1st passed the literacy, there was a literacy test that you should have scored a 50%.

126
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:17.409
PLP Academy: Okay. So once we ensured you. Are there? Then this is our core learning modules. These are the basics. You learn software engineering essentials, what you're learning correctly.

127
00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:20.109
PLP Academy: For the 1st 2 weeks.

128
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:29.359
PLP Academy: Then you learn also database you learn web development, employability and startup building

129
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.470
PLP Academy: and python. Those are basic modules.

130
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.899
PLP Academy: So this will take week, one up to around week 9. So you will go with them up week, one to week 8. You land us. Okay?

131
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:48.489
PLP Academy: Then after that, you will

132
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.240
PLP Academy: have to specialize after week. 8

133
00:16:53.268 --> 00:16:56.779
PLP Academy: that is on week 9. You have specialization.

134
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:03.520
PLP Academy: Now on specialization. You specialize on full stack development month.

135
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.599
PLP Academy: These.

136
00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:12.480
PLP Academy: It. It means man stands for Mongo, dB, express react and node. Js, okay.

137
00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:23.830
PLP Academy: so man is specialization of web applications. It means you'll be a full developer, full staff developer in web applications.

138
00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:31.910
PLP Academy: So software testing is all about being able to

139
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.140
PLP Academy: guarantee and prioritize performance of software.

140
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:41.189

146
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:29.310
PLP Academy: after that, you can also specialize in AI and software engineering, whereby you run AI machine learning.

147
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.760
PLP Academy: you'll learn how to model AI machines

148
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:38.530
PLP Academy: and how you can automate tasks using? AI, okay?

149
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.760
PLP Academy: So basically, that's it. You can only specialize in one.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:55.080
PLP Academy: Okay? So by the time you are at week 9, why not? You have, you have, evaluated yourself, maybe. What are your interests in tech?

151
00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.799
PLP Academy: And then you will know which one to specialize in.

152
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:06.310
PLP Academy: Okay, then, how will the program do? So ours

153
00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:13.059

PLP Academy: Okay, we also, we also have gaming sessions on Saturdays from 11 am. To 12 pm. 1 h. Okay, so make sure you join in

158
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.790
PLP Academy: for games.

159
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.200
PLP Academy: Your running is a bit gamified. It's good.

160
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:50.039
PLP Academy: So how it works is that for the foundation for software engineering essentials runs for 2 weeks with one and 2 Monday to Friday.

161
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.640
PLP Academy: Then we have full stack

162
00:19:53.810 --> 00:20:03.150
PLP Academy: week, 2 to 8, whereby you'll be learning about database, entrepreneurship, web development, python and gaming on Saturdays. Alright.

163
00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.100
PLP Academy: then finally, we have specialization

164
00:20:06.787 --> 00:20:14.999
PLP Academy: week, 9 to week, 15 or 16. There. Okay, so you'll have. That's how you'll spend your 16 months your 16 weeks.

165
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:28.770

166
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.130
PLP Academy: So basically, that's how your program is will be load out something else to note

167
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:43.599
PLP Academy: some of the key Lms features is my learning, submission, timetable groups, community ticketing, dashboard

168
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:49.939
PLP Academy: faqs, I've already shown you faqs and ticketing it. I've dealt with those 2.

169
00:20:50.665 --> 00:20:57.790
PLP Academy: Shortly after our deal with them. With all these I'll show you how to work with all these others

170
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:08.059
PLP Academy: cool. All right, then. Some of the learning activities you get involved in is things like master class

171
00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:21.089
PLP Academy: master classes. A master class is a simply a virtual class that happens once, and you are taught by an industry, a professional from the industry of tech.

172
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.630
PLP Academy: And then he will explain a concept. Maybe

173
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:34.680
PLP Academy: any concept be like, maybe AI agents, how you can maybe use AI agents in your job automation skills

174
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.260
PLP Academy: like one we had last weekend it was about AI agents. Yeah. So that is a master class.

175
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.580
PLP Academy: It happens once. So make sure you

176
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.529
PLP Academy: in your learning process you should at least attend 2 master classes. Okay?

177
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.280
PLP Academy: Also hack account.

178
00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.309
PLP Academy: There is. There'll be hackathons. A hackathon is a competition.

179
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.700
PLP Academy: a competition to showcase your skills

180
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:22.819
PLP Academy: in terms of how you can implement your skills by solving real world solutions. Okay, so you are giving real world solutions to real world problems. Okay? So make sure you attend at least 2 hackathons in your running progress.

181
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.540
PLP Academy: Weekend challenges.

182
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:31.570
PLP Academy: boot camps. These are challenges that will come up during weekend, where you. You also contest for coding

183
00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.010
PLP Academy: and developing great softwares

184
00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:44.239
PLP Academy: over the weekend, and you can do it in groups. That's the beauty of it. Yes, you don't have to struggle around

185
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.870
PLP Academy: on her cabons. You can be able to present

186
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.339
PLP Academy: a project or an idea as a group or as an individual.

187
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.560
PLP Academy: Then we have coffee and coat.

188
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.410
PLP Academy: since most of our running is virtual.

189
00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:14.020
PLP Academy: We have a physical event we call coffee and cold. So we we gather, maybe, for example, in an institution. Mostly this happens in Kenya and Nigeria, because that's where we have a lot of presence, physical presence students.

190
00:23:14.742 --> 00:23:18.190
PLP Academy: We. We we look forward to expanding

191
00:23:19.009 --> 00:23:28.009
PLP Academy: coffee and coat to other countries as time wraps up. Yes, we we will check how we can be able to.

192
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:36.860
PLP Academy: And lab, that we meet physically, we share coffee. We could.

193
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.379
PLP Academy: Okay, yeah. So that is that

194
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.230
PLP Academy: then we have town hall sessions.

195
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.289
PLP Academy: These are sessions designed for you to give feedback.

196
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.549
PLP Academy: Okay? So you have a session for giving feedback

197
00:23:51.790 --> 00:24:02.320
PLP Academy: on. Maybe your progress. Maybe you're stuck somewhere. You can be able to raise your hand and say, Hey, I'm how finding it difficult here. And here, please help. And you get helped. Okay.

198
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.589
PLP Academy: we also have guest lectures.

199
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.241
PLP Academy: Now, guest lectures are those

200
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:17.899
PLP Academy: moments when, for example, I'm the read Module instructor for software engineering. You can invite others lecturers to come and

201
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.770
PLP Academy: playing on a concept like tomorrow.

202
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.540
PLP Academy: Invite a guest lecture just to take you through it. And github

203
00:24:26.267 --> 00:24:31.700
PLP Academy: so I can invite guest lecturers to take you through a concept.

204
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:39.269
PLP Academy: Yeah. Guest lectures. We talk of guest lectures, then we have certification.

205
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.800
PLP Academy: Now, the certification. Here we have 2 types of certificates.

206
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.180
PLP Academy: The 1st type of certificate is certificate of achievement.

207
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.079
PLP Academy: It's awarded to those who meet evaluation criteria, that is.

208
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.429
PLP Academy: you develop a fully functional project

209
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.290
PLP Academy: and you successive freeze. Submit a pitch deck.

210
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:16.040
PLP Academy: So certificate. This certificate of achievement recognizes outstanding performance and the ability to apply learn skills

211
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.980
PLP Academy: in a practical setting.

212
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.980
PLP Academy: So recipients of these, anyone who receives this certificate of achievement.

213
00:25:24.757 --> 00:25:30.260
PLP Academy: Will be pressed in the talent. Tama.

214
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:36.430
PLP Academy: full of job opportunities, access and potential career placements.

215
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.570
PLP Academy: We intend to praise more than 3,000

216
00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.720
PLP Academy: people to connect more than 3,000

217
00:25:43.336 --> 00:25:49.270
PLP Academy: people to jobs. So make sure you fall under this certificate of achievement.

218
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:57.719
PLP Academy: Yes, you deliver a competent, fully functional project at the end of your 16 weeks of running, then

219
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:04.930
PLP Academy: we have certificate of participation. Say, for example, for whichever reasons you are not able to

220
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:11.719
PLP Academy: do a fully functional project, and you are not able to deliver a pitch deck. So

221
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:17.449
PLP Academy: you but you are active on the Lms. Very active.

222
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:27.599
PLP Academy: and you followed through all the modules you completed them 100%. Remember, as you study the module, it will show you the percentage you've covered.

223
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:34.290
PLP Academy: Okay. So assuming you've covered all the modules to an extent of 100%.

224
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:42.080
PLP Academy: This certificate is meant to acknowledge your commitment in learning.

225
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.490
PLP Academy: even if there is piece even if you do not meet any additional evaluation criteria.

226
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.449
PLP Academy: So

227
00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:55.529
PLP Academy: The only thing that it doesn't do it does not grant you access to current hub

228
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.629
PLP Academy: or job opportunities. So this one, after you are done.

229

PLP Academy: we say, thank you for participating. God bless you. And happy future. Okay.

230
00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.350
PLP Academy: yes. So that is how it goes.

231
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:15.999
PLP Academy: So for achievement, you are required to have a fully functional project, a pitch deck

232
00:27:16.804 --> 00:27:21.589
PLP Academy: recognition or level that it means you have an outstanding performance.

233
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:30.520
PLP Academy: and it will also give you access to parent hub and job access. So it's required for you to be able to progress

234
00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:37.239
PLP Academy: your piece for participation. All you need is commitment in learning.

235
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:48.050
PLP Academy: Okay, yes. So that is it, and make sure that you are able to

236
00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:55.380
PLP Academy: progress on every module, a hundred percent, and you are good that one will give you

237
00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.599
PLP Academy: participate certificate of participation.

238
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:06.740
PLP Academy: Then we go to project evaluation criteria. Now for those I hope most of you and I hope all of you will go for project

239
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.439
PLP Academy: a certificate of achievement.

240
00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:19.929
PLP Academy: So that guys, you get pressed for jobs. Okay, yes, those jobs are for you. 3,000, plus all the jobs are for you.

241
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:27.010
PLP Academy: Okay? So make sure you do that. You join in so that you can be able to

242
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.039
PLP Academy: grab yourself a job.

243
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:36.250
PLP Academy: So when you deliver a project, we check one on code quality.

244
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.900
PLP Academy: What's the quality of your quote.

245
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.360
PLP Academy: you run Whatsapprod quality as you progress.

246
00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:48.740
PLP Academy: Okay, documentation. We'll check on how you've documented your solution.

247
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.410
PLP Academy: The quality of your pitch deck.

248
00:28:52.570 --> 00:29:01.040
PLP Academy: how well organized your pitch deck. Do you learn how to organize speech decks here very nicely and swiftly.

249
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:07.030
PLP Academy: the innovations and problem solving skills you have shown in your problem.

250
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:13.700
PLP Academy: We check your user experience engagement with your

251
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.279
PLP Academy: project. That is the software product you're creating.

252
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:24.300
PLP Academy: And we will also check conversion control. Mostly, we do this using git hub.

253
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:35.800
PLP Academy: So for you to be able to progress in this module, whether you will get a certificate of achievement or participation, you must have a Github account.

254
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:45.329
PLP Academy: So through Github account we can be able to check on your commitment and the commits the type of

255
00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.420
PLP Academy: oh.

256
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:54.580
PLP Academy: engagements you've made with your project so that we can know that for sure. This is your project.

257
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.430
PLP Academy: and this one is, we are very keen, especially for those group projects.

258
00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:07.840
PLP Academy: You can't claim to be doing a group project. Mostly group projects will involve 5

259
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.360
PLP Academy: or less between 3 to 5 people.

260
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.040
PLP Academy: Now, you can't claim to be doing an old project.

261
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:27.360
PLP Academy: and you've done nothing. You have 0 commits for that project on your Github Lepo. Okay, so we will check to certify that if you're saying, this is a group project.

262
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:38.980
PLP Academy: then you've already participated. You've already done enough and you've done your work

263
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.400
PLP Academy: in the group project. We check that.

264
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.840
PLP Academy: Okay.

265
00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:50.249
PLP Academy: yes. And I think that's a that's a good thing that you can be able to do project as a group.

266
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:55.529
PLP Academy: It's a beautiful thing. Yeah, you can be able to present one as a group

267
00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.410
PLP Academy: in group of 3 to 5 maximum cool.

268
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:06.410
PLP Academy: And finally, we do reach out to you guys.

269
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:12.430
PLP Academy: just in case we realize you've not been able to log in to the Lms.

270
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:19.809
PLP Academy: Because I've told you that learning here happens on the elements. So if you realize that you've not been able to

271
00:31:20.594 --> 00:31:25.490
PLP Academy: attend classes, live classes, or even check on Lms

272
00:31:26.657 --> 00:31:32.379
PLP Academy: we might reach out to you through the contacts. Info you've given us. That is, email

273
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.860
PLP Academy: for phone calls, texts, or maybe Whatsapp chats.

274
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:44.509
PLP Academy: And just see whether we can help you to catch up and to come, maybe to be able to

275
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.600
PLP Academy: come back to the running process. Okay.

276
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.180
PLP Academy: yes. So we can reach out to you

277
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.109
PLP Academy: and then reach outs happen once per month.

278
00:31:55.350 --> 00:32:00.510
PLP Academy: not everyone here and then, but mostly once month.

279
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.849
PLP Academy: Okay, that's say so. You'll be having pitching sessions.

280
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.780
PLP Academy: You'll be taught how to pitch your projects

281
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.260
PLP Academy: definitely from week 9, I think. There. So.

282
00:32:14.043 --> 00:32:25.170
PLP Academy: And then what you do, you 1st project, do project submissions and evaluations and the selection of the top projects begins. Once you

283
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.600
PLP Academy: are done with your final project.

284
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.909
PLP Academy: then we have group pitching guide.

285
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:38.930
PLP Academy: So just in case you want to pitch as a group. We have a special guide for you. How it is done. As a group.

286
00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.360
PLP Academy: We have presentations to the entrepreneurship team.

287
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.120
PLP Academy: That is the 1st team you pitch to.

288
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.099
PLP Academy: they will check the quality of your

289
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:56.579
PLP Academy: pitch, deck product and so forth. And then they were maybe validated

290
00:32:57.168 --> 00:33:02.250
PLP Academy: maybe to go to the next step, whereby you have one on one pitching guide as well.

291
00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:09.849
PLP Academy: And then, there is the presentation to Prp management team, and after that

292
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:15.989
PLP Academy: they will select the Prp management team will select the top 3 best projects

293
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.340
PLP Academy: and those top 3 best projects are awarded during graduation.

294
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:27.370
PLP Academy: And you're given cash cash bids in dollars.

295
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:32.349
PLP Academy: Okay, nice cash bits. I think the 1st project last year one

296
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.650
PLP Academy: was given, I think, $12,000.

297
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.510
PLP Academy: Wow!

298
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.570
PLP Academy: What can you do with $12,000.

299
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:47.439
PLP Academy: Oh, just for doing your work. Okay? Because I think that's good money. So yeah.

300
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:59.560
PLP Academy: I hope the money will still remain the same. So yeah, there's a cash bid for you. You'll be given a gift. You'll be gifted. I wanted that if your project is among the top 3,

301
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:06.210
PLP Academy: all right, so make sure you do deliver a good

302
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.029
PLP Academy: competent projects so that one you don't miss out the cash.

303
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.410
PLP Academy: I think 12,000 can really come in handy.

304
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.950
PLP Academy: Doras can really come in handy.

305
00:34:17.032 --> 00:34:22.440
PLP Academy: Yeah, you know, in such a, in such a, in such a

306
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.629
PLP Academy: project competence. Competition. Okay, that's good.

307
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:33.809
PLP Academy: Then there is the graduation part. So our graduation is virtual. It happens virtual

308
00:34:34.841 --> 00:34:38.630
PLP Academy: after we've still done assessment and certification.

309
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.660
PLP Academy: So we check on class attendance.

310
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:52.839
PLP Academy: We check on the Faroes active participation project, completion, master classes and boot camps and town halls and pitch deck submission. We'll check on all that.

311
00:34:54.139 --> 00:35:01.049
PLP Academy: Yes, allow me to speak about deferrals. If you ever check on deferral.

312
00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:08.570
PLP Academy: maybe for any reason you are not able to continue with the learning

313
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:15.149
PLP Academy: you can defer, but deferring means you. It will affect your future eligibility.

314
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.100
PLP Academy: scholarship. You cannot be considered for any future scholarship.

315
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.670
PLP Academy: because it means you when you are given that opportunity.

316
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:35.139
PLP Academy: You didn't maximize on it. And so we can't trust that even if you're given it again, you can be able to utilize it. Okay.

317
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:40.190
PLP Academy: yes. So that's how it can affect your progress.

318
00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:49.069
PLP Academy: So we have a talent department that checks on you once you finish the calls

319
00:35:49.848 --> 00:36:01.709
PLP Academy: it gives a nice assessment the complete project. Polish up Cv. And check all the boxes that you've got all it takes, and then they craft a pitch deck for you

320
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.200
PLP Academy: so that you can be able to do an elevation pitch to

321
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:11.670
PLP Academy: industrial employers. And yeah, they help you in job placement.

322
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.349
PLP Academy: I hope all of you get to that department.

323
00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.340
PLP Academy: Yes, we hope to transition out of you.

324
00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:33.980
PLP Academy: So if you don't participate, if you lack active participation in the program, you will be dropped off.

325
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.510
PLP Academy: you will be dropped off.

326
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:43.270
PLP Academy: That means we realize that you are not attending classes. You are not accessing the elements.

327
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.850
PLP Academy: So what, however, just happened will just be dropped off.

328
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:56.840
PLP Academy: and you'll be discontinued from the program, and you will not be accepted in future. Cohorts.

329
00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.640
PLP Academy: Sponsorship.

330
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.450
PLP Academy: Okay.

331
00:37:01.626 --> 00:37:09.309
PLP Academy: I had already talked about deferment. Yes, so the it is. And like I said, if you defer

332
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:19.030
PLP Academy: you, it might affect it will directly affect your future eligibility, feature, scholarship, and sponsorship.

333
00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.370
PLP Academy: Okay, so that is it.

334
00:37:25.038 --> 00:37:27.909
PLP Academy: And that is that.

335
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.279
PLP Academy: So? That is how why we are here.

336
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.509
PLP Academy: And I hope everybody got it clear as to why we are here.

337
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:37.849
PLP Academy: All right.

338
00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.590

341
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.670
PLP Academy: I know I've given you a lot of information.

342
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.769
PLP Academy: Yeah, so just order it. Yeah.

343
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.410
PLP Academy: I'll come to your questions at the end of my

344
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.220
PLP Academy: after after this. Shortly after this

345
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:23.140
PLP Academy: I'll address all the questions, so keep them posted on the Q. And A. Section.

346
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:30.810
PLP Academy: Yeah, I might not be able to follow up the chat. So make sure you maximize on the Q&A section. I think I'll be able to follow up that.

347
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.470
PLP Academy: Okay, nice.

348
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.069
PLP Academy: So how shall we be here.

349
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.759
PLP Academy: So we will be here by attending classes on the Lms.

350
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:54.569
PLP Academy: So this is the Lms, so basically on the Lms, the 1st part is my learning.

351
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:59.500
PLP Academy: So my learning, you should see the modules that are accessible to you.

352
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:08.059
PLP Academy: For example, at this point you should only have one module, that is, software engineering, only

353
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:13.970
PLP Academy: the rest will appear and they will unfold as you progress.

354
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:26.420
PLP Academy: Okay? So after 2 weeks you'll have access to database entrepreneurship and personal development skills, web technologies, python and such, you get

355
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:32.320
PLP Academy: as you progress. When you go to specialization based on your specialization.

356
00:39:33.718 --> 00:39:44.620
PLP Academy: You'll have access to other modules like AI for software engineering, full stack web man develop with development, with man, software testing and such.

357
00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.599
PLP Academy: So that is that and that and fat as well.

358
00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:58.480
PLP Academy: So. But as for now so the only module you should be able to see is software engineering.

359
00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:04.940
PLP Academy: Yes, software engineering role. Okay, so there you

360
00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:15.269
PLP Academy: is where you get the lessons. So you click on software engineering. You see, there are 2 types. There is curriculum. You click on day one you'll be able to see day one.

361
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.700
PLP Academy: for example, lesson one, how to use the Lms.

362
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:28.409
PLP Academy: It's very nice lesson the aim of this lesson is just to is the lesson we are learning today.

363
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:36.280
PLP Academy: It's basically to help you run through the Lms. There are some videos, nice videos. You can watch

364
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.429
PLP Academy: on how to work on the Lms.

365
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:46.469
PLP Academy: And everything. For example, we can see how to work on peer to peer as a group.

366
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:56.000
PLP Academy: Hello! This is how you access the peer-to-peer review feature on the Lms system on the left navigation menu. Select my groups

367
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:19.700
PLP Academy: under my groups, select your designated group, which will be listed on the my groups. Page. This will navigate you to a page with features such as your group, name submissions, and peer to peer review feature on the peer to peer review page, you'll find options such as the group name the submitted file, the rating and ad review view, the submitted files

368
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:26.639
PLP Academy: for which you are making a review for, and then make a review of the file on the add review option

369
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:38.709
PLP Academy: cool. So we give you that opportunity. You'll be having opportunity to run as groups so you can be able to work as groups

370
00:41:39.528 --> 00:41:44.309
PLP Academy: on may, maybe assignments. You have assignments that you can work on as a groups.

371
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.969
PLP Academy: We call them peer to peer groups. So we'll be grouped soon.

372
00:41:50.059 --> 00:41:58.659
PLP Academy: So you to access peer groups. You just need to check on groups the groups option. You'll find your group there.

373
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.930
PLP Academy: and mostly there is

374
00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:10.239
PLP Academy: group members. I was up Link, where you can be able to link up with those group members. And I believe that has already been done.

375
00:42:10.878 --> 00:42:14.860
PLP Academy: We should be in already in a clear group.

376
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:20.510
PLP Academy: And yeah, making sure that you are running together. It's for easy learning.

377
00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.880
PLP Academy: That's it.

378
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.830
PLP Academy: After my learning we have dashboard

379
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.169
PLP Academy: dashboard. You check on your progress.

380
00:42:34.732 --> 00:42:37.019
PLP Academy: Mostly, for example.

381
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:44.810
PLP Academy: Oh, just in case this message appears, rewrote.

382
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:51.920
PLP Academy: Maybe it tells you it couldn't load anything, just load the page. It should behave well.

383
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:57.019
PLP Academy: For example, you will get the progress of every module

384
00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:02.720
PLP Academy: you are on. For example, let me check on my software engineering

385
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.369
PLP Academy: and see progress, 80%. Okay, cool. So there are things I need to do get

386
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:17.069
PLP Academy: so for you to get a participation, a certificate of participation.

387
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:22.380
PLP Academy: you should at least finish all these modules up to a hundred percent.

388
00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:31.880
PLP Academy: That's cool. It will give you the progress. That's why we have dashboard just for you to be able to see the progress. You'll also see the Reader Board.

389
00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:39.659
PLP Academy: See on the Reader Board you get to see who is leading in terms of Lms usage. Okay.

390
00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:44.980
PLP Academy: You know, some of you are here today. Maybe it's your 1st time to log in the Lms.

391
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:48.470
PLP Academy: The Ms. Was opened for you guys on Friday.

392
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:55.840
PLP Academy: and now on Friday evening I remember there is a student who called, who who emailed me

393
00:43:56.090 --> 00:44:01.070
PLP Academy: and asked me how to progress to week 5 assignment.

394
00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.180
PLP Academy: I don't know how fast she was

395
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:21.079
PLP Academy: able to navigate through the Lms. I think she was waiting for it to be open now. Once it was opened, she went through, did all the assignment. And I think she got some challenges. And I helped her to be able to

396
00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.040
PLP Academy: overcomplete that challenge. So

397
00:44:24.584 --> 00:44:34.020
PLP Academy: basically, that's it. So there's there are people you realize there are people who do very much on the Lms. So every activity you do on the Lms is like Connect.

398
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.920
PLP Academy: And because it's recorded, it's given an award.

399
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:46.479
PLP Academy: Given an art so like, if you are 1st one like this guy here for this cohort

400
00:44:47.165 --> 00:44:54.030
PLP Academy: you'll receive a badge free badge of being there on the Reader board for the Lms.

401
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:59.669
PLP Academy: Okay, yes, you can see my score is quite down I need to improve

402
00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.300
PLP Academy: on how I'm using my Nms

403
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:13.640
PLP Academy: cool. Cool. Oh, I need to work hard. Okay, cool. So if your Lms score is very down, work hard to be on the leaderboard.

404
00:45:14.496 --> 00:45:25.200
PLP Academy: Okay? And so that you can receive those badges. Okay, so that is dashboard. It shows you your progress. You'll be able to see your progress

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.300
PLP Academy: your quiz results. Unfortunately, I don't think I've

424
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.849
PLP Academy: I don't think I've submitted them.

425
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:25.370
PLP Academy: I don't think so. I've not submitted it. So there is no data for me, no data that can be.

426
00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.310
PLP Academy: Let me see the software development. Okay.

427
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:32.739
PLP Academy: nothing. I don't think there is anything for me there.

428
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:37.560
PLP Academy: But if maybe you submitted also assignment.

429
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.749
PLP Academy: you will see the assignments you've submitted here.

430
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:46.100
PLP Academy: Okay, where they are, you'll be able to see the assignment submitted.

431
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:54.309
PLP Academy: Say, for example, let me show you how to submit assignment. So you just go to my learning.

432
00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:05.130
PLP Academy: let me see, let me check for a for a module. I've not unload because I know for software engineering I've unload.

433
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.090
PLP Academy: But okay, let me, let me just use software engineering.

434
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.720
PLP Academy: It's okay.

435
00:48:12.364 --> 00:48:14.379
PLP Academy: So there you go.

436
00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:27.769
PLP Academy: let's go to the one assignment, the one assignment

437
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.940
PLP Academy: there is the assignment. I'm there. I'm on the assignment.

438
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.180
PLP Academy: so you are told to follow instructions, provided

439
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:39.349
PLP Academy: the deadline is on March that 1, 2520, 25.

440
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:47.769
PLP Academy: So make sure that by March, that one you've are done with all the software engineering essentials.

441
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:57.300
PLP Academy: Oh, assignments. And you are done. Okay? So there are some good instructions of how to like

442
00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:06.240
PLP Academy: be able to go around they assignment alright.

443
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:10.880
PLP Academy: So you read those instructions, and after reading the instructions.

444
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.530
PLP Academy: you go ahead now and do the assignment

445
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.619
PLP Academy: so you can click here, click here.

446
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.590
PLP Academy: we right click once you right click.

447
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:27.050
PLP Academy: say, open right link in a new tab open link in a new tab. There you go.

448
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:36.280
PLP Academy: and it should open and ask you to accept. Once you accept, you should find this. Okay

449
00:49:37.408 --> 00:49:39.560
PLP Academy: you should find a Github web.

450
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:42.959
PLP Academy: So click on that, Github repo, you find.

451
00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:48.909
PLP Academy: okay. The reason why you have seen that for me it has not prompted me to accept

452
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:59.619
PLP Academy: is because I've accepted the I've accessed these assignment before you get so click on the Github level.

453
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:05.040
PLP Academy: So you need a Github account before you attempt an assignment.

454
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.280
PLP Academy: You need a github account.

455
00:50:08.412 --> 00:50:12.769
PLP Academy: And you don't have to worry. I'll show you how to create one. It's very easy.

456
00:50:13.302 --> 00:50:17.810
PLP Academy: You don't have to worry. You don't have to struggle creating a github account.

457
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:23.370
PLP Academy: So once you're on your Github account repo.

458
00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.759
PLP Academy: All you need to do is make sure you.

459
00:50:28.053 --> 00:50:29.260
PLP Academy: For example.

460
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.665
PLP Academy: Oh.

461
00:50:37.026 --> 00:50:44.360
PLP Academy: make sure you are on that level. And once you are on the Lepo, that is software day one.

462
00:50:45.417 --> 00:50:47.149
PLP Academy: Project the eighties.

463
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.949
PLP Academy: Just edit. Edit. This.

464
00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:54.810
PLP Academy: Lead me this lead me. Fire is the one you edit.

465
00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:01.999
PLP Academy: Okay, see here, there is a prompting you open in visual studio code. You can do that. No problem.

466
00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:07.580
PLP Academy: But I think the most important thing is just a bit.

467
00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:12.260
PLP Academy: Update this software this lead me?

468
00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:18.330
PLP Academy: Answer the questions. You see, there are questions here, answer them in your best knowledge possible.

469
00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:21.359
PLP Academy: and then commit once you commit

470
00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:28.470
PLP Academy: and save, commit the changes, just click here at code and check for https.

471
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:44.050
PLP Academy: Copy the URL alright, copy the URL alright, and once you copy the URL just go in.

472
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:48.160
PLP Academy: paste it at the submission part.

473
00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.969
PLP Academy: And it's that easy to submit an assignment.

474
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:57.400
PLP Academy: Okay, you just paste it there and submit.

475
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:05.709
PLP Academy: Okay, now, it is possible, for example, sometimes to light, click the link.

476
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:26.650
PLP Academy: and instead of giving you it, or instead of it redirecting you to a repo. For example, the way you've seen, I've right clicked. Opening a new tab, I found a nice lepo that has got good information. It is possible that this Lepo, you click here. It's possible for you to be directed in an empty Lepo.

477
00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:39.710
PLP Academy: An empty report is a report that has nothing. Okay, so don't worry in case that happens just right. Click here there is. So that's that's why there is that instruction. If redirected to an empty repository.

478
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.970
PLP Academy: follow these instructions below.

479
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.420
PLP Academy: So you link you right click

480
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:54.949
PLP Academy: open in a new tab. So this one it will give you a document that has the questions. The same questions you would have found

481
00:52:55.150 --> 00:53:06.310
PLP Academy: on the Github repo. Okay, so copy of these questions. You can just copy all right.

482
00:53:07.318 --> 00:53:09.510
PLP Academy: And once you copy

483
00:53:10.345 --> 00:53:16.019
PLP Academy: you can even answer fast. 1st answer the questions and copy. Then copy, paste

484
00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:22.820
PLP Academy: you paste them on a readme file. You just come here and now on the empty lepo

485
00:53:23.435 --> 00:53:32.580
PLP Academy: you can add a new file. You can add a new file, just add a new file, and on that add new file. It should be a readme.

486
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.240
PLP Academy: and so that I don't need me. Fire.

487
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:40.229
PLP Academy: and on that lead me fire. Make sure.

488
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:46.139
PLP Academy: Make sure. Oh, I've not signed in. That's why it cannot be able to. Okay.

489
00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.150
PLP Academy: let me sign in so that you can be able to see.

490
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:04.999
PLP Academy: Okay, so cool. So

491
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:22.809
PLP Academy: so you can add a new file. Just add a new file, create a new file. Make sure it's a readme copy. Paste your work there. Okay, just paste. Let's assume we are pasting, copy, paste your work there and then commit. Okay.

492
00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:31.490
PLP Academy: and once you commit you make sure you give your fire a name. Maybe you call it assignment

493
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:40.859
PLP Academy: assignment, whatever maybe assignment one or day one assignment.

494
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:47.310
PLP Academy: Yes, so let's call it day, one day one assignment

495
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:54.249
PLP Academy: and md. Dot dot markdown file.md.

496
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:57.909
PLP Academy: then I can commit the changes. Okay.

497
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:04.870
PLP Academy: that's all. You can commit the changes, and that's all you see.

498
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:10.140
PLP Academy: So that is what you do here. It is. So the assignment will be created here.

499
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:21.949
PLP Academy: Get I've created it. That was an assumption like the way I've told you. Assuming you are open an empty nepo. That's how you go about it, you create a new

500
00:55:22.881 --> 00:55:30.490
PLP Academy: repo and you you make sure that you just create a new file and add it to your repo to that repo that you found empty.

501
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:37.779
PLP Academy: But if the empty, the file repo is not empty, it has an assignment like this one. Just click edit

502
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:44.369
PLP Academy: type your answers to the best of your knowledge, for example.

503
00:55:45.345 --> 00:55:59.940
PLP Academy: and maybe once you are done, commits changes, and once you commit changes you could.

504
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.220
PLP Academy: Then you can just come here at code.

505
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:13.699
PLP Academy: Make sure it's on https, not Ssh or Github Cri. Just that, and then copy the URL

506
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:22.650
PLP Academy: alright. Copy the URL and then go to Erp academies, submit

507
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:30.699
PLP Academy: and then submit. You paste this submit and then submit. Okay, parade venture. You realize.

508
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:32.450
PLP Academy: Sorry a minute.

509
00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:13.029
PLP Academy: Okay. So, para adventure. You have entered the long, maybe submission at your submission level. 1st submission, you submitted the wrong link.

510
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:20.660
PLP Academy: You can just go to your oh, Github Lepo, correct.

511
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:26.829
PLP Academy: pick the correct link, and then once you pick the correct link, come here at submissions.

512
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:42.590
PLP Academy: and then assignment submission, check on the assignment that you submitted wrongly, and then edit. Click, edit, you can change the link and then update. You just need to maybe like

513
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.790
PLP Academy: delete that link.

514
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:50.129
PLP Academy: And then you paste the new link that you think is correct and then update.

515
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:56.099
PLP Academy: Hear that the assignment link will be updated successfully.

516
00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:57.650
PLP Academy: Cool.

517
00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.249
PLP Academy: It's that easy.

518
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:08.490
PLP Academy: I hope that clears the air on how to submit assignment, how to correct assignment links.

519
00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:15.520
PLP Academy: and how to make sure that you update your assignment links just in case you submitted along

520
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.160
PLP Academy: or repo assignment.

521
00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:22.099
PLP Academy: Now note, you must have a Github account for you to be able to attempt an assignment

522
00:58:23.128 --> 00:58:28.650
PLP Academy: you just need to go to github.com and github.

523
00:58:31.104 --> 00:58:36.610
PLP Academy: com oh, not dashboard! just.com.

524
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:43.600
PLP Academy: It will sign into my dashboard. Let me sign out

525
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:49.789
PLP Academy: so that you can see what you will see if it's your 1st time to see Github.

526
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.045
PLP Academy: Okay?

527
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:57.159
PLP Academy: So there I go. This is what you find in the beginning. Okay.

528
00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.580
PLP Academy: just say, sign up for Github.

529
00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.570
PLP Academy: Okay?

530
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:11.889
PLP Academy: And just create an account. Just like the way you create an email account or any other online account, you'll be told to test whether you are a robot. Make sure you verify you are not a robot.

531
00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.279
PLP Academy: and you'll be good.

532
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.540
PLP Academy: Alright. Yes, you'll be pretty cool.

533
00:59:18.756 --> 00:59:25.900
PLP Academy: Maybe you and don't struggle. You should not struggle to create a github account. Just go to Youtube.

534
00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:29.500
PLP Academy: com

535
00:59:30.768 --> 00:59:39.281
PLP Academy: maybe for easy for easy throw, I've told you. Struggles struggling. We left it to our independent, our forefathers,

536
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.859
PLP Academy: Who are struggling for our independent.

537
00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:47.139
PLP Academy: So nowadays we don't struggle. There is information for anything you want to do.

538
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:51.470
PLP Academy: So just say creating a github account.

539
00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.690
PLP Academy: Github account

540
01:00:02.523 --> 01:00:18.050
PLP Academy: creating a github account. Okay? Yeah. So there is very many videos to show you how to create Github account, even how to use Github. Okay, yes. And how to work around. Github. Yeah. So

541
01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:21.220
PLP Academy: just so do not struggle.

542
01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.800
PLP Academy: Do not struggle in any way. Okay, yes, all right, that's it.

543
01:00:27.701 --> 01:00:34.460
PLP Academy: Hopefully, by tomorrow make sure you have a Github account, or by after this make sure you have a Github account.

544
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.580
PLP Academy: and you can be able to submit the assignment

545
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.260
PLP Academy: alright. After that there is the community tab.

546
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:52.600
PLP Academy: Now on the community Tab, you can get to connect with other people all right.

547
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:55.779
PLP Academy: And you can get to

548
01:00:57.702 --> 01:01:08.800
PLP Academy: connect with other people who have been in the Peer Peep Academy program. Okay? Yes. And you can comment, you can cheer others. You can, for example, help

549
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:16.920
PLP Academy: Anthony Mordeki is asking, has anyone successfully registered for today's class? And you can comment.

550
01:01:17.712 --> 01:01:21.010
PLP Academy: yes, I have. Yes, okay.

551
01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:24.730
PLP Academy: cool. So you see. So that's that's it.

552
01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:43.720
PLP Academy: Maybe if somebody knows you, for example, you can see. Somebody asked him. Told him to use Google meet. Maybe there is. That's a buddy who knows Anthony Madiki and then use. He asked him to use Google meet. Okay, I don't know which kind of class is that.

553
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:48.320
PLP Academy: But maybe they they had a crash on Google. It could happen okay.

554
01:01:53.460 --> 01:02:01.939
PLP Academy: if you had. If you have made any posts you check here on, what have you posted?

555
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.239
PLP Academy: Fortunately, I've posted nothing so far. So good.

556
01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:08.316
PLP Academy: Okay, yes.

557
01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:13.750
PLP Academy: This. This account is just to help you to understand

558
01:02:14.591 --> 01:02:24.520
PLP Academy: the runner. It the learner perspective. Actually, I don't use this, I use my admin account. So merely, will I post anything. This?

559
01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:27.250
PLP Academy: Okay, that's cool.

560
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.340
PLP Academy: So that is that interact with the community.

561
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:39.470
PLP Academy: The more you interact with the community, the more it you earn, more rewards points. That's that's really helps to gain reward points.

562
01:02:40.876 --> 01:02:44.800
PLP Academy: Finally, but not least. But we have gemini tab.

563
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:49.449
PLP Academy: This is the tab that I hope you will interact with the most

564
01:02:50.466 --> 01:03:01.590
PLP Academy: because it is very helpful in when it comes to like walking around in the

565
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:09.340
PLP Academy: Lms. So especially for your assignment, you can always con connect with Gemini

566
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:19.440
PLP Academy: and with the light prompts it can help you to successively. Do your assignment? Well, okay.

567
01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.249
PLP Academy: yes. So it's a good tool

568
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:36.929
PLP Academy: and also notes. Maybe there is something you've read and you've not understand. You've not understood. Well, say, for example, you are on my learning, and some something was just mentioned. Belief. Maybe, like, for example, you find

569
01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:49.450
PLP Academy: something like software project management was highlighted. And you are like, what is that? Then you can just come here. Ask Gemini what is software project management?

570
01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.810
PLP Academy: It will give you nice details of what is software project management, and

571
01:03:56.422 --> 01:04:02.079
PLP Academy: gemini will never be mad at you to tell you. Oh, you've asked me too many questions.

572
01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:06.600
PLP Academy: Yeah, he, Gemini? Mr. Gemini is a good one.

573
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:11.589
PLP Academy: who will always answer your queries as they come through.

574
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.210
PLP Academy: So hope you interact with Gemini more.

575
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:21.809
PLP Academy: Finally, we have the certificates part whereby, if you have any certificates, they'll be posted here.

576
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.320
PLP Academy: Alright.

577
01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.629
PLP Academy: Yeah, they'll be posted here

578
01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:33.859
PLP Academy: and you will enjoy the certificates any certificates you have. Maybe you've participated in power hack

579
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:35.470
PLP Academy: or hacker bombs.

580
01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:38.029
PLP Academy: You will see that as certificates

581
01:04:38.893 --> 01:04:51.690
PLP Academy: updated there, or maybe you've completed your session, you have a certificate of participation. It should appear there, or certificate of achievement, it should appear there

582
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:53.980
PLP Academy: cool also.

583
01:04:55.133 --> 01:05:01.280
PLP Academy: Now here there is, some more information about

584
01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:10.319
PLP Academy: Your cohort, for example. This was for safaricom book cohort

585
01:05:10.924 --> 01:05:16.020
PLP Academy: channel. So so for you as it should be leading Feb. 2025

586
01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:21.628
PLP Academy: cohort. Yes. Oh, cohort, I mean cohort 6, if I'm not long.

587
01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.710
PLP Academy: Oh, yeah.

588
01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.609
PLP Academy: So that is the Lms.

589
01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:35.720
PLP Academy: Concerning your your Ms.

590
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:37.830
PLP Academy: Profile.

591
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.239
PLP Academy: You can set it the way you want.

592
01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:46.270
PLP Academy: But not very necessary, though.

593
01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:53.199
PLP Academy: even if you leave some parts and updated no problem, it will never affect your progress.

594
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.040
PLP Academy: Okay, yeah. But it is good to

595
01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:59.999
PLP Academy: make sure you update this this sector.

596
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:08.849
PLP Academy: up to these about make sure you can update for the final project. You'll update the link once you

597
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:11.809
PLP Academy: start your final project. Okay?

598
01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:17.060
PLP Academy: Alright, the rest you can update as you wish.

599
01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.185
PLP Academy: Cool, that's cool.

600
01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:25.260
PLP Academy: But remember, the more you

601
01:06:26.848 --> 01:06:35.009
PLP Academy: like engage with Lms the better the points. So for better points. Make sure you feel like all of this.

602
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.320
PLP Academy: It's beautiful.

603
01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.330
PLP Academy: Okay, that's it.

604
01:06:40.812 --> 01:06:43.469
PLP Academy: Now let's check a few things

605
01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:51.139
PLP Academy: on my learning a few things on my learning.

606
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.159
PLP Academy: So we've checked on how to do assignments.

607
01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.320
PLP Academy: We've checked on events.

608
01:06:59.156 --> 01:07:02.489
PLP Academy: So at least you know what's event. Notification.

609
01:07:03.736 --> 01:07:08.650
PLP Academy: There will be notification. Most 3 of you download content. Okay?

610
01:07:09.672 --> 01:07:14.169
PLP Academy: Yeah, that is, you download content. Mostly.

611
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:21.639
PLP Academy: That's when notification comes in, or they. If there is a new message on community that concerns you, you have a mention

612
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:23.489
PLP Academy: to be Updated there.

613
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:29.999
PLP Academy: So let's say, for example, we've read this lesson. You see, this lesson.

614
01:07:30.835 --> 01:07:32.499
PLP Academy: Is being recorded.

615
01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:36.360
PLP Academy: So where will you find the recordings of this lesson?

616
01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:42.660
PLP Academy: You just need to come at the one, for example, and check for a reason that has

617
01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:53.669
PLP Academy: your cohort name recording. For example, you can see here we have safaricom boot grass recordings. Leave that that does not belong to you. It was for them. Okay.

618
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:56.509
PLP Academy: we go to lesson 5

619
01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:02.539
PLP Academy: Feb. Cohort. Feb. 2025 cohort recordings. Click on that. That's where your recordings are

620
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:09.019
PLP Academy: now you'll find there is, for example, the lies, the live class morning Session.

621
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:14.699
PLP Academy: This was a recorded class. This is the recorded version of the class that happened in the morning.

622
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:18.119
PLP Academy: It's always good to check. You might find that

623
01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:20.890
PLP Academy: even though all crafts are similar.

624
01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.930
PLP Academy: Okay, maybe there's something I said in the morning

625
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:40.050
PLP Academy: that I have not said in this class, okay? Or maybe there's something I've said in this class that I didn't say in the morning, or that I will say in the evening you get there could be one or 2 or more variations, so you can check for your own good.

626
01:08:40.694 --> 01:08:54.329
PLP Academy: So for you to be able to view the recordings. Click on the live class. Right? Click all the links on the Lms. You have to right. Click. They are not. They don't operate by clicking. You have to right click

627
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.470
PLP Academy: open. Maybe.

628
01:08:56.729 --> 01:09:01.960
PLP Academy: So once you open copy this passcode.

629
01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:02.979
PLP Academy: Okay?

630
01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.169
PLP Academy: You have to copy it because you'll be asked for it.

631
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.150
PLP Academy: I think I had accessed it. If it's your 1st time to access it.

632
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:17.900
PLP Academy: you'll be asked for a passcode, so make sure you copy it and give it for you to be able to view.

633
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.189
PLP Academy: But for me, I think I had accessed it. I had to test

634
01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:26.650
PLP Academy: whether it was working before I came to class. So that's why it has just opened.

635
01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:50.320
PLP Academy: So then you pray that I could be able to navigate. As you can see, they are working.

636
01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:55.540
PLP Academy: That is how you should be able to access recordings just in case you Miss Cross.

637
01:09:55.710 --> 01:10:05.510
PLP Academy: It also works good for you if you want to. Now, the best thing about to deal with this recording download it to your machine local machine. Why.

638
01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:09.570
PLP Academy: Lms is a dynamic platform, as you can see.

639
01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:12.409
PLP Academy: And so things keep on changing.

640
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:20.079
PLP Academy: Okay, things keeps on changing. So for your better. Access of such recordings

641
01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:28.770
PLP Academy: download them. And because they are very long, you see, like this recording is around 2 h. If I'm not long.

642
01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:31.429
PLP Academy: Yes, 1 h, 51 min.

643
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.820
PLP Academy: That's quite a long recording it.

644
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.280
PLP Academy: So watch it on nets.

645
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:42.609
PLP Academy: Maybe it might. If you are using Bados you will struggle, but if you are not using burles. Very good.

646
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:46.710
PLP Academy: but for future accessibility.

647
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:52.519
PLP Academy: you know, as time goes, for example, I think in the morning we tried to access the shook

648
01:10:52.943 --> 01:11:02.339
PLP Academy: recordings and they were not available. After one month or so the recordings will be deleted. They are not there forever. Okay, they are just there to help you to catch up.

649
01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:06.020
PLP Academy: Okay? So it's assumed that after one month

650
01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:17.577
PLP Academy: you have catched up everything you wanted to catch up. So just in case for future reference of your own. You can download, you can just download. There is always this

651
01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:23.289
PLP Academy: button download, so download them download the

652
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:30.909
PLP Academy: recordings so that you can enjoy them even offline. Okay, yes, it's easier that way.

653
01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:38.380
PLP Academy: Yeah. And I've told you, after one month they will be deleted. They will be not be available after one month, so

654
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.449
PLP Academy: no cool, so far, so good.

655
01:11:44.679 --> 01:11:54.490
PLP Academy: That said also on the oh, for example, on the

656
01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:05.900
PLP Academy: say, for example, now we access software engineering. The first, st this kind of the 1st lesson of your module.

657
01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:11.969
PLP Academy: Okay, nice cool. There you are.

658
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:18.390
PLP Academy: So you can see there is the rest on content. Okay?

659
01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:26.120
PLP Academy: And this content is accessible. If you want to run this code, you must install an SDK

660
01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:27.800
PLP Academy: like Vs code.

661
01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:36.050
PLP Academy: Okay, where you don't have to worry. What's Vs code? Just go to your browser

662
01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:45.650
PLP Academy: check for Vs code B is good, simple, yes, correct.

663
01:12:46.538 --> 01:12:55.190
PLP Academy: You'll learn how to install this tomorrow. So today I will not go into details of installation. I'll just go to show you where you can find it.

664
01:12:56.324 --> 01:13:00.600
PLP Academy: Download the Vs code model of your choice.

665
01:13:01.599 --> 01:13:07.889
PLP Academy: That. That is not what I want. You can click download button, so if you click download button.

666
01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:17.400
PLP Academy: you should be able to see models either is for windows or Linux or Mac Download

667
01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:21.960
PLP Academy: and be happy. Install. Then you can copy and learn

668
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:26.551
PLP Academy: that code. The code for the code to run. You need a Vs code,

669
01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:31.550
PLP Academy: Yes, you need Vs code. You won't learn just like that.

670
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:36.489
PLP Academy: Okay, yeah. Copy the code on Vs code and learn it. It will learn

671
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:43.300
PLP Academy: also. You might need, for example, this is a python code if I'm not Hello.

672
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.530
PLP Academy: and since this is a python code.

673
01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:53.590
PLP Academy: mostly the the codes here are python. Actually the codes here. Most of them are python.

674
01:13:54.170 --> 01:14:02.159
PLP Academy: So for you to be able to run, you also need to install python. Okay? So come here and type python.

675
01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:09.540
PLP Academy: Just don't struggle. I told you there is no struggle. We don't struggle nowadays. Okay, python.

676
01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.260
PLP Academy: Welcome to python.org. Yeah. Nice.

677
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:18.210
PLP Academy: Come here to downloads download for your windows

678
01:14:18.905 --> 01:14:26.790
PLP Academy: either windows or Mac. If you are on Linux, you don't have to worry. Python comes installed in Linux by default.

679
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:32.789
PLP Academy: Okay, yes, where, even in windows, Python comes installed.

680
01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:36.050
PLP Academy: But it is good to install this one

681
01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:40.349
PLP Academy: for reasons I will tell you later on day 3

682
01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:48.150
PLP Academy: as we will be, or tomorrow, maybe I will tell you tomorrow. So today let me not dive into that. Okay.

683
01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:51.750
PLP Academy: so you can download and install. That is that

684
01:14:52.818 --> 01:14:59.310
PLP Academy: for you, for that code to run. Okay, I'm just telling you, just in case you want to test that code.

685
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:10.129
PLP Academy: Yes, primarily. That's how you go around that now there is downloading the content.

686
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.100
PLP Academy: For example, you want to download this content.

687
01:15:14.105 --> 01:15:17.210
PLP Academy: There is a file. There is the download content.

688
01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:20.059
PLP Academy: Doc. Button, you click on it.

689
01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.349
PLP Academy: It will send you an email.

690
01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:29.999
PLP Academy: an Amir with download details on your email, okay, download content.

691
01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:35.859
PLP Academy: So that is that but also

692
01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.619
PLP Academy: there could be sorry also there could be

693
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:52.349
PLP Academy: additional resources. For example, you see this link. It has an additional link resources. For example, introduction to software engineering. Right? Click on it.

694
01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:59.099
PLP Academy: open link on a new tab. It will directly read you to guide you to the presentation

695
01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.360
PLP Academy: representation on software engineering.

696
01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:06.130
PLP Academy: So

697
01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:21.219
PLP Academy: it's very key. You note that most of the resources to access extra resources within the URL, you right click there, rings don't try clicking, they will not respond. They are not responsible just one click.

698
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:26.770
PLP Academy: and that is to ensure that you are not boggled, you know. Boggled by

699
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:30.740
PLP Academy: anything that you meet that needs to be clicked. Okay.

700
01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:44.120
PLP Academy: yeah, it's the focus is to make it easier. The reason why we make sure that you can only right click to get a resource. It means that you need to. You are at that point when you need that resource. Okay.

701
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.510
PLP Academy: yes. So to make your work easier.

702
01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:51.090
PLP Academy: Cool. So that's that

703
01:16:51.570 --> 01:17:00.340
PLP Academy: there is always a video. Some lessons have video content, not. Or I've just said not my words. Some lessons.

704
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.200
PLP Academy: Video content.

705
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:06.980
PLP Academy: Like, I think this one should have video content.

706
01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:14.919
PLP Academy: Yeah, cool, I think. Why is it not getting it? It should get it.

707
01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:16.660
PLP Academy: And we'll see.

708
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:18.120

858
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:47.710
PLP Academy: Yes, I'm pretty. Jenna.

859
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:55.190
PLP Academy: Oh, is it possible to do

860
01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.340
PLP Academy: 2 modules given, I'm able to pursue them.

861
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:03.720
PLP Academy: No, you only choose one

862
01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:13.359
PLP Academy: but what it is not restricted. You can attend the classes for other modules. There is no restrictions toward that. You can attend the classes for other modules.

863
01:32:13.670 --> 01:32:27.680
PLP Academy: and you can also develop a project in them. So there is no problem but for specialization you choose one. But if you want knowledge on other modules, it's available. Just attend the class, do the projects they are given

864
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:29.199
PLP Academy: wearing goods.

865
01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:33.070
PLP Academy: Okay, yes, but specialization ordinary one.

866
01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:36.110
PLP Academy: How is cross attendance?

867
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:37.480
PLP Academy: Trucked?

868
01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:42.379
PLP Academy: Very easy. If you just attended, it means you had registered.

869
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:46.290
PLP Academy: And so that registration was registered on zoom.

870
01:32:46.890 --> 01:32:54.830
PLP Academy: and zoom helps us to analyze your data for all the attendance the class the attendees who did attend today's class.

871
01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.670
PLP Academy: Yes, your soul.

872
01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:01.130
PLP Academy: We get very easily

873
01:33:02.126 --> 01:33:08.350
PLP Academy: as well. Also, if you attended using your Lms and you clicked on the class session

874
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:10.189
PLP Academy: by a cross session.

875
01:33:10.570 --> 01:33:23.720
PLP Academy: we it's also very easy to attend, because, after the session, Zoom will tell me how many students? Why, but login has all your details there on the Lms as well.

876
01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:33.330
PLP Academy: Okay, Gloria Mkwana, is it normal that I have absolutely no study materials on my Lms, no, it's abnormal.

877
01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:43.529
PLP Academy: You should have, at least on my learning. There should be one module that is software engineering essentials, this one software engineering.

878
01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:50.060
PLP Academy: So in case that's the then laser ticket, I said, you just come here, raise a ticket.

879
01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:53.929
PLP Academy: do your name, your email, your number.

880
01:33:54.430 --> 01:34:00.770
PLP Academy: your category of issue. Maybe you say content issue because you don't have content.

881
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:11.000
PLP Academy: And then, continue, give it a subject you don't have maybe anything there on my lms, and then.

882
01:34:11.587 --> 01:34:20.279
PLP Academy: explain a bit. Give a simple explanation of your lms, you can even screenshot to show better. Okay? And then raise the issue

883
01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.310
PLP Academy: cool.

884
01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.250
PLP Academy: I think I showed that before.

885
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:26.999
PLP Academy: So it's not normal.

886
01:34:28.418 --> 01:34:32.169
PLP Academy: Let me see any other question on here.

887
01:34:33.553 --> 01:34:39.510
PLP Academy: How can someone access the day? One assignment cause? There is no link to the assignment or submission link

888
01:34:40.110 --> 01:34:42.600
PLP Academy: the restaurant of the day the same.

889
01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:54.479
PLP Academy: So so you can see if once you go to software engineering essentials, you go to day one

890
01:34:55.050 --> 01:35:01.090
PLP Academy: part of less than 5 day one

891
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:06.859
PLP Academy: there is the quiz, the survey, and the last part is assignment day, one assignment.

892
01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:13.269
PLP Academy: That's how you access it, just in case your Lms. Does not have this.

893
01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.749
PLP Academy: Maybe it has the reason they wanted to raise a ticket.

894
01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.410
PLP Academy: Okay, yes.

895
01:35:23.190 --> 01:35:31.279
PLP Academy: The lessons we are attending are all the same, like what we are doing in this lesson is what we did in the morning. Okay.

896
01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:38.489
PLP Academy: yeah. So just choose to attend one. Don't struggle to attend twice. Not unless maybe

897
01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:45.099
PLP Academy: you enjoyed the class so much, and maybe you want to enjoy the same. Maybe it's okay.

898
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:50.160
PLP Academy: But the content is the same who makes the groups.

899
01:35:52.380 --> 01:36:00.150
PLP Academy: The groups will be assigned. Eventually you are assigned groups by their domain.

900
01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.170
PLP Academy: Now by the Admin, just like the way you are

901
01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:08.039
PLP Academy: given login access the same way.

902
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:10.739
PLP Academy: Brief as I should go to brief.

903
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.179
PLP Academy: I think I've answered Jeff, how to attend new class.

904
01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:24.389
PLP Academy: How do I do? I connect Nigerian group members?

905
01:36:27.057 --> 01:36:30.940
PLP Academy: Stephanie, I think you're in Nigeria.

906
01:36:36.010 --> 01:36:39.379
PLP Academy: in your groupings you'll be grouped, as

907
01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:44.079
PLP Academy: I think, in the groupings. I'm not very sure with how you are grouped.

908
01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.139
PLP Academy: The criteria might not be that you are from the same country.

909
01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:55.729
PLP Academy: But maybe you can reach out and see whether there is a Whatsapp group. You can.

910
01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:02.179
PLP Academy: Okay, we. We encourage you guys. You can use any means of communication you can you want.

911
01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:06.920
PLP Academy: But the best way would go via telegram, go via telegram

912
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:15.670
PLP Academy: and check whether there is a way, a way, a way of checking for example.

913
01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:22.119
PLP Academy: ask the discuss group on the discuss group, ask who are

914
01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:25.029
PLP Academy: connect with members from your country.

915
01:37:25.450 --> 01:37:29.999
PLP Academy: I think they can be able to connect from there. You can even offer.

916
01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:37.139
PLP Academy: I was up, maybe Link, and they can be able to join from there that that can happen.

917
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.210
Evans Mutuku: Okay.

918
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:41.816
PLP Academy: Yes, alright, that's

919
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:47.099
PLP Academy: How is class attendance checked?

920
01:37:47.410 --> 01:37:51.960
PLP Academy: I've trunked, I think I've already explained that double chamber

921
01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:56.950
PLP Academy: some classes collides with my invest. How can I access direct charitor?

922
01:37:57.410 --> 01:38:01.679
PLP Academy: I've already shown that just in case you've missed the lecture.

923
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:12.020
PLP Academy: we just need to go to my learning check on plus lesson buddies.

924
01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:15.299
PLP Academy: maybe. Day one, for example. Check on

925
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:24.859
PLP Academy: there is a reason for your recordings like, for example, for you, it will always be Feb. 2025 cohort recordings.

926
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:29.329
PLP Academy: Check there, and there you'll find the recording.

927
01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:35.650
PLP Academy: You'll find the recording. Even this lesson will be posted there afterwards.

928
01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:40.169
PLP Academy: For example, you can see the morning class is already posted.

929
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:49.140
PLP Academy: You can be able to light creek and log in and enjoy cool.

930
01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:53.199
PLP Academy: Make sure you use the passcode to access the view

931
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:57.370
PLP Academy: without that passcode, you cannot access the view.

932
01:38:58.050 --> 01:39:03.950
PLP Academy: Alright yes, so that is how you do it oh,

933
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:13.709
PLP Academy: so you sign in how do you sign in for class attendance. You just need to go to class sessions.

934
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:21.649
PLP Academy: click on the session, and then there is, there will always be a choice of.

935
01:39:22.614 --> 01:39:30.400
PLP Academy: For example, if I click here, you can see there is click here to register and join the session. That's how you do it.

936
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:37.460
PLP Academy: Okay, thanks. Today, I'm very reliant. I'm asking your questions.

937
01:39:38.455 --> 01:39:43.069
PLP Academy: Thank you for your time. I want to focus on our online presence.

938
01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.840
PLP Academy: Oh.

939
01:39:50.530 --> 01:39:51.260
PLP Academy: yeah.

940
01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:05.199
PLP Academy: yeah, I said, currently, the only module you should be able to see is

941
01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:16.829
PLP Academy: software engineering. The rest will appear as you continue. For example, others like Python will appear after 2 weeks

942
01:40:30.362 --> 01:40:35.669
PLP Academy: so software engineering will only go for 2 weeks, 10 days, actually.

943
01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:42.329
PLP Academy: yes, and the content is arranged in 5 days every day has at least 2 lessons.

944
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:43.570
PLP Academy: Yeah.

945
01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.230
PLP Academy: So make sure you check that.

946
01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:53.935
PLP Academy: And let me check for a question that I've not answered. The program is self paced. You should,

947
01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:59.540
PLP Academy: be able to be free to lead at your own pace.

948
01:40:59.930 --> 01:41:11.270
PLP Academy: But we will explain a few concepts here and there. You can also always ask questions. It's expected that before you come to class, you've already covered by yourself whatever is on the

949
01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:20.240
PLP Academy: place on the Lms, and you can be able to ask questions and interact with your read instructor.

950
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:27.480
PLP Academy: okay, what is the acceleration in doing this course, accreditation

951
01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:50.900
PLP Academy: the prudence, Cadure, oh, the certification you get in Prp is globally recognized.

952
01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:58.360
PLP Academy: Yeah, it's globally recognized. Think of it as a certificate like the one you do in Microsoft

953
01:41:58.930 --> 01:42:08.060
PLP Academy: or the one you're doing, maybe oracle because it shows a skill. Okay, yes, I think that is that

954
01:42:08.210 --> 01:42:17.630
PLP Academy: for joy, prudence is it mandatory for one today

955
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:23.830
PLP Academy: to do the day. One quiz immediately after day. One classes, or one can do it any other day.

956
01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:27.770
PLP Academy: It all depends on how fast you want to move.

957
01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:33.150
PLP Academy: like I've said. For example, I gave an example.

958
01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:42.770
PLP Academy: There was this student who called me on Friday. Once on Friday, once you were given the Login access. That night a student called me not called, but emailed me

959
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.930
PLP Academy: and

960
01:42:45.150 --> 01:42:57.479
PLP Academy: and she told me that she was already on day 4, and she wanted to go to day 5. Okay, because it's self paced. It's you to determine how you wanna go.

961
01:42:57.870 --> 01:43:02.330
PLP Academy: All right, so you can do it immediately. You can wait.

962
01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:10.219
PLP Academy: The only thing is that you cannot be able to move to next week's content without having done the quizzes and the surveys and the assignments in

963
01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:11.300
PLP Academy: one day.

964
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.960
PLP Academy: Okay?

965
01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:16.850
PLP Academy: Oh, no.

966
01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:24.440
PLP Academy: Check your email, check your Internet. If your Lms is not loading, check your Internet.

967
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:41.730
PLP Academy: The recordings are live after class. I'm checking for a new query.

968
01:43:51.303 --> 01:43:58.719
PLP Academy: We haven't pitch decks. Everything you do is virtual, even pitch deck.

969
01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.330
PLP Academy: It's virtual.

970
01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:02.820
PLP Academy: We don't have physical classes.

971
01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:04.520
PLP Academy: Yeah.

972
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:17.440
PLP Academy: So group somebody is telling me. Have groups been formed or confirmed that you? I don't know. I don't have access to your cohort

973
01:44:18.224 --> 01:44:24.579
PLP Academy: like content, like the way I have. I've told you what I have here is what was for Safaricom.

974
01:44:25.423 --> 01:44:34.189
PLP Academy: So I'll check out whether your groups have been formed. I'm not fully aware of that. So I would be. I'm not in a position to answer that.

975
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:36.540
PLP Academy: Oh.

976
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:52.189
PLP Academy: no, the lessons are not continuation. Each lesson is a repetition of what have been happening

977
01:44:52.330 --> 01:44:54.780
PLP Academy: the whole day, so choose only one.

978
01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.670
PLP Academy: Oh.

979
01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:09.800
PLP Academy: there is no say. For example, we have a hackathon

980
01:45:11.276 --> 01:45:17.689
PLP Academy: power hack, power, hack power. They are called power hacks. So if you have a power hack session.

981
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:23.729
PLP Academy: then for that you have to travel, say, for example, we say we have power hack at UOM.

982
01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:26.550
PLP Academy: If you need to participate in that.

983
01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.929
PLP Academy: you can. You have to travel, you get but layered. We have such.

984
01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:39.889
PLP Academy: Most of the hackathons are virtual. Most sort of our hackathons are virtual, but at times we can have a powerhouse.

985
01:45:40.871 --> 01:45:44.480
PLP Academy: Which maybe it's done in a specific place.

986
01:45:45.496 --> 01:45:52.259
PLP Academy: Mostly we? That's when you might need to travel. But, Larry, like last cohort, we didn't have one.

987
01:45:52.977 --> 01:45:58.259
PLP Academy: We we no longer. We we discourage such because we want you guys to

988
01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:01.540
PLP Academy: do things call virtually.

989
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:04.070
PLP Academy: And since our program is virtual

990
01:46:04.619 --> 01:46:10.729
PLP Academy: we realize that that program is not really good for our students. So what we have is

991
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:19.410
PLP Academy: coffee and cold sessions. Those are the only physical things. If you want to travel where and good you can. So, for example, if we have.

992
01:46:19.770 --> 01:46:23.700
PLP Academy: we have, for example, we have upcoming. On February 28, th

993
01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:26.230
PLP Academy: we have a coffee and cold events.

994
01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.010
PLP Academy: Oh, for

995
01:46:30.374 --> 01:46:39.489
PLP Academy: Safaricom, not for you guys. So if you want to to participate in that, you can travel to, it will be in

996
01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:48.040
PLP Academy: Saint Paul's University. You can travel there your way there. Okay, but you don't have to

997
01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:57.349
PLP Academy: for you guys. We don't expect a lot from you. We don't expect you to do. February 28 is on Friday. So we don't expect that maybe you

998
01:46:58.490 --> 01:47:11.529
PLP Academy: you'll be. We don't expect to engage with for the previous cohort, but not for you guys, for you guys before we create an event. We have also to ensure that we have

999
01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:17.339
PLP Academy: equipped you to be in in a position to

1000
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:22.949
PLP Academy: enjoy that event. We don't want to call you to events where you fought.

1001
01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:30.190
PLP Academy: Okay, yes, that's cool. I think I've answered you better.

1002
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:33.610
PLP Academy: Oh.

1003
01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.309
PLP Academy: so I'm doing my university coursework in parallel, so may not be able to.

1004
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:53.040
PLP Academy: So this is how it works. Maybe you are not able to attend a live class.

1005
01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:57.669
PLP Academy: Make sure you go to the Lms and follow up on the recording.

1006
01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:06.370
PLP Academy: Okay, that's why you have a recording. Alright. We understand you could be busy on other things. But make sure you follow the recording

1007
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:13.559
PLP Academy: so that your consistency on the Lms shows up.

1008
01:48:14.290 --> 01:48:18.620
PLP Academy: Yes, and live classes always make sure you find time to attend one.

1009
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:25.010
PLP Academy: Yes, 80% of life crashes is required. Remember that. Yes.

1010
01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:58.260
PLP Academy: So I don't know which assignment you attempted, and it's checking August 2024 cohort.

1011
01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:11.219
PLP Academy: But our assignments are that way, I don't think whichever assignment you get. Maybe I don't know could be that it's

1012
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:13.270
PLP Academy: you on your edit didn't.

1013
01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:24.960

01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:27.480
PLP Academy: yeah, don't worry

1015
01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:35.149
PLP Academy: of any other thing is Sd. Day, one and maybe day, 2 day, 3 day that.

1016
01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:44.860
PLP Academy: Okay, I think that's cool. I think I've answered most of your questions. Anyone with a query, maybe

1019
01:50:10.110 --> 01:50:17.679
PLP Academy: The date. It is you who open the content, I've already explained. Say, for example, you have done the assignments.

1020

PLP Academy: I have just to come here and click this button unlock next week.

1024
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:56.549
PLP Academy: Yes, then I'll be told there's a quiz I have to attend, so make sure you attend the quiz after you complete. Maybe there is an assignment complete, and then click, unlock again. This the week 2 will be unlocked.
